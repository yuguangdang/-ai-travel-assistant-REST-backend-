https://au.travelctm.com/blog/enhancing-business-travel-with-agile-travel-technology/,"Enhancing business travel with agile travel technology  Technology resides at the heart of the business travel experience. When applied successfully, it delivers value and productivity to organisations, while also enhancing the individual traveller’s experience. Today, every aspect of a journey can be managed with the touch of a button for maximum productivity, reliability, comfort, and enjoyment. With the constant advancements intechnology, travel management companies need to focus on enhancing business travel with agile travel technology, providing customers with quick and easy access to the most innovative and meaningful travel tools. AtCorporate Travel Management(CTM), we understand this need and the importance of flexible and transparent development processes that respond directly to customer needs. That is why our technology teams across the world have adopted the ‘agile’ approach to building and upgrading our own proprietary travel technology. What is agile? Agile incorporates multiple methodologies based on iterative and incremental development. The best solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams. This process has been chiefly used in software development to improve speed to market and productivity. Traditionally, development processes have been more linear and rigid, which heightens the risk of creating unsuitable tools that are out of date at the time of delivery. Customer benefits The agile process allows customers to see tangible results at regular intervals throughout product development and share related feedback to drive further enhancements. Critically for the fast-paced travel industry, the agile approach speeds up development processes and provides the capacity to pivot and change plans within an ever-changing landscape, while also keeping to tight deadlines.  The speed of change Change is one of the few constants in the travel industry and this demands a timely response from travel management companies. CTM is committed to a rapid deployment cycle for technology releases that keep pace with continuously evolving market conditions. Our teams execute the development lifecycle in smaller increments, known as ‘sprints’. This allows for iterative product enhancement that can be delivered within days and weeks, contrasting with the more cumbersome approach of projects being planned upfront and executed against that plan. Continuous integration, continuous delivery When starting a new project, our teams look for ways to automate the build, test, and deployment pipeline. CTM’s development pipeline progresses from understanding customer requirements, designing then developing a solution, and running tests, through to deployment. This is followed by a feedback and review process where further enhancements can be incorporated.  Customer comes first CTM puts the user front and centre of technology development. We communicate directly with customers at every stage of the process, helping us to move quickly from idea generation to deployment. Through our CTM User Labs, customers have early access to products and this, coupled with our iteration model, allows us to source direct end-user insights and data. This connects the people who build our products with the people who use them. This collaborative approach provides a better understanding of customers’ specific requirements, while our continuous feedback loops empower them to share ideas on how to improve our product offering. We integrate this information with the latest market and industry intelligence. As a result, CTM delivers flexible technology that is engineered to last, and our tools are the most intuitive, responsive, and easy to use on the market. Global network, local solutions CTM’s global technology strategy is delivered by regional development teams which work out of technology hubs in all four of the market regions we operate. Within these hubs, our cross-functional teams work closely together on projects with an immediacy that delivers results. While our global network is underpinned by compatible systems and processes in every market, our local tech teams understand exactly what is happening on the ground in their regions. They liaise directly with customers to ensure localised, tailored solutions that are both meaningful and relevant to businesses of all sizes. Technology that delivers CTM recognises the role agility can play in meeting and exceeding customer expectations. Our technology development roadmaps are built around tomorrow’s travel landscape, ensuring we are always one step ahead. Whether keeping travellers informed while on the road or allowing Travel Arrangers to make the best decisions for their businesses, CTM has powerful and reliable tools to meet our customers’ unique and ever-changing travel needs.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/switch-to-lightning-online-travel-booking-tool/,"Why switch to Lightning for your online travel booking tool?  Every modern travel program needs an online travel booking tool, but they’re not all created equal. While some offer a basic booking function that ticks a box, the overall experience can leave travellers frustrated with slow interfaces, unintuitive workflows, and limited content that leaves money on the table. AtCorporate Travel Management(CTM), we knew there had to be a better way to improve the travel booking experience and help our clients save money. That’s why we designed Lightning – to bring speed, savings, sustainability, and simplicity to the business travel booking experience. Gain more hours in the day Travellers have more to do in their day than book travel, so a tool that is fast and efficient is often desired. Lightning’s user-friendly, modern interface enables travellers to book travel in 90 seconds, with fewer clicks than other booking tools. At-a-glance details that break down each fare type and cabin class, show if it’s refundable, or apply a ticket credit, to give travellers exactly what they need to make the best choice. Lightning also reduces repetitive tasks by letting Travel Arrangers book up to 9 travellers in one transaction. With baggage add-ons and loyalty status recognition at time of booking, Lightning eliminates time spent going back to an airline’s website, keeping your people in the right booking channel for payment, duty of care, and data reporting. A frequent challenge with other online travel booking tools and technology is that they can be slow to make updates or add new features. Lightning is anagile productthat runs on two-week development cycles that regularly integrate customer feedback into new feature development and customisations. Other TMCs may have to petition for changes in third-party tools, whereas Lightning’s priorities and roadmap are directly driven by our clients. Need to book or cancel a trip and don’t have time to call someone? Located within CTM Portal, our intuitive new travel chatbot, CTM Scout, can help you book your next domestic or trans-Tasman trip or cancel a booking in just a few clicks. Booking through CTM Scout is exclusive to Lightning customers, which knows all your travel preferences and travel policy inside out, ensuring the most relevant, cost-effective, and compliant booking support at maximum speed, so you can get what you need to be done to get on with your day. See more savings Whether it’s time, money, or energy, Lightning is engineered to bring savings to your travel program. With intelligent and inclusive content, including low-cost carriers you can stop searching around multiple sites to get the best priced fares. Owning our technology also means no reseller fees passed on to our clients. Do you struggle with staff going around company policy to book travel that’s non-compliant and over budget? Lightning’s powerful integrated policy settings gently guide travellers on what they can and can’t book, helping to reduce out-of-policy spend without them having to read the travel policy manual. Fare classes or carriers that are outside company policy can still be shown in results if you choose, but are unavailable to be booked so travellers know they are seeing everything to make the best choice.  Keeping track of unused ticket credits before they expire can be tedious, especially for larger companies. Ditch that manually updated spreadsheet and get organised with Lightning’s unused ticket tracker. Lightning helps keep track of your ticket credits for you, and even automatically applies them to your cart so you never waste a ticket or your budget again. Make greener choices As more companies track, reduce, or offset their carbon footprint, travellers need to be able to clearly see and understand green options when booking travel. Lightning displays carbon emissions estimates for air, hotel, and car rentals in search results, so your people can instantly see their potential impact and make greener choices. CTM partners with RDC Aviation to sharecarbon emissions estimates by cabin classin Lightning based on individual aircraft’s age, engine model, fuel efficiency, seating configuration, and even the airline’s investment in sustainable aviation fuel.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/how-ctm-delivers-smarter-co2-calculations-for-business-travel/,"How CTM delivers smarter CO2 calculations for business travel  Did you know that by switching flights, you could save more CO2emissions than it takes to power your home for three months? In a joint study by CTM and RDC Aviation of popular airline routes flown by CTM’s customers, we found thatswitching to a different flight on the same day could reduce emissions by between 19% at the low end, to as high as 49%. On a Sydney to Singapore flight, switching from one airline’s business class to another’s on the same day resulted in a reduction of 563.04kg CO2e,compared to the 467.5kg CO2e to generate the 1,375kWh of electricity required to power the average Australian home for three months, or even charge your smartphone phone 68,485 times. Smarter business travel CO2 calculations at the point of search and booking in Lightning Corporate Travel Management’s (CTM’s) partnership withRDC Aviationbrings unparalleled accuracy and granularity in CO2emission calculations for flights, making it the top choice for business travel managers and companies seeking sustainable travel options. RDC’s proprietary fuel burn calculation, combined with their comprehensive database of over 35,000 airframes, enables us to display CO2emissions at the point of booking in Lightning that vary by flight, airline, aircraft type, and origin-destination pair. This level of detail empowers business travellers to make informed decisions about their environmental impact when choosing which flight to take. By considering factors such as airline-specific seat configurations, cabin class, and CO2emissions per kilometre, businesses, and their travellers can optimise their travel choices to minimise their carbon footprint. RDC’s calculations power search results for CO2 in Lightning in addition to our Carbon Budget tool and Climate+ dashboards dedicated to helping organisations track, forecast, and offset their carbon emissions from business travel.  How flight CO2 emissions are calculated Here are the key factors CTM and RDC use to calculate CO2emissions to help CTM customers make more informed decisions at the point of booking in Lightning: Enter the green room – how hotel emissions are calculated CTM uses DEFRA greenhouse gas (GHG) calculations for hotel stays. DEFRA, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is a UK government department responsible for environmental protection and sustainability. DEFRA hasdeveloped a comprehensive methodologyadopted by companies and organisations globally to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions, including scope 3 emissions, which are indirect emissions from sources such as business travel. Each year, DEFRA updates a global list of hotel conversion factors by country, which you can access via the UK Government’s website. Here’s what you need to know about DEFRA’s hotel calculations: How is hotel conversion data sourced? DEFRA sources hotel conversion factors from the Hotel Footprinting Tool, a software tool developed between the International Tourism Partnership and Greenview. The tool collects data on hotel stays, such as the location, duration, and type of room from the Cornell Sustainability Benchmarking Index that uses annual data from international hotel companies and a standardised industry methodology to calculate the associated greenhouse gas emissions. On the road to greener business travel with car hire calculations Rental cars come in all shapes, sizes, and engine types, with varying emissions to match. Lightning makes it easy for business travellers to see the lowest emissions vehicles with a CO2calculation for each car based on an average use of 161km per day. Individual car hire companies share model-type emissions with GDSs like Sabre, Amadeus, and Travelport which CTM uses to display this information. Lightning goes further by including hybrid and electric vehicle choices, and the ability to sort and filter by CO2emissions and engine type, so you can easily find the most sustainable choice when you need a car.  Taking charge of your program emission with Climate+ By using CTM’s combined conversion factors for different travel segments such as flights, hotels, and car hire, your travellers get accurate guidance when booking travel. WithCTM Climate+,  travel and sustainability managers have one intuitive set of interactive dashboards and reports to analyse and measure the scope 3 emissions associated with their employees’ business travel all in one place. CTM Climate+ can be used to report on the company’s overall carbon footprint, identify areas where emissions can be reduced, and forecast offsetting costs based on live carbon market data. By making use of CTM’s end-to-end technology stack, organisations can develop sustainability strategies to support their business travel and contribute to the global effort to mitigate climate change.

Delta signs SAF agreement with CTM The three-year deal will reduce lifecycle emissions by 209 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Contact our expert team to discuss your travel program’s climate neutrality objectives today."
https://au.travelctm.com/news/delta-signs-saf-agreement-with-ctm/,"2 July 2021 Delta signs first multi-year SAF agreement with CTM, reaches collective purchase of 300,000 gallons with corporate partners Delta Air Lines, the first carbon neutral airline on a global basis, and Corporate Travel Management (CTM), an award-winning global travel management company, have signed a multi-year sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) agreement. The three-year deal will reduce lifecycle emissions by 209 metric tons of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 256 acres of U.S. forests. This partnership is the first multi-year SAF commitment for Delta and builds on the growing list of travel management companies and corporate partners that share in Delta’s commitment to bolster the future of sustainable air travel. In total, 300,000 gallons of SAF have been purchased in collaboration with Delta’s corporate partners. This means life cycle emissions from Delta operations will be reduced by 2,100 metric tons, which is equivalent to removing 457 passenger vehicles from the roads for one year. “These partnerships are a core driver for decreasing the aviation industry’s reliance on conventional jet fuel and encouraging the economic viability of SAF by building industry demand and supply,” said Delta’s Amelia DeLuca, Managing Director –Sustainability. “The collective impact we are making with our corporate partners delivers real change for the industry.” With a future vision of zero-impact aviation, Delta’s first step is to solve for its largest impact on the environment—carbon dioxide emissions. To do so, it is investing in the readily available resources that can make a difference today, like SAF, which has limited supply and a ticket price 3-5 times that of conventional jet fuel. It is why partnerships like the one with CTM are necessary. “CTM is committed to developing and supporting initiatives that provide practical and sustainable benefits to businesses, the environment and local communities,” said Kevin O’Malley, Chief Executive Officer of Corporate Travel Management North America. “We are proud to take this next long-term step alongside Delta in supporting the lasting sustainability of our planet by reducing the impact of business travel on the environment.” SAF is a critically important lever in Delta’s Flight to Net ZeroSMas it reduces the life cycle carbon emissions from aviation fuel. In its pure form, it can reduce life cycle carbon emissions up to 80 per cent compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. The collaboration with CTM and other corporates including Deloitte and Nike underscore the significant positive environmental impact that can be achieved through collaboration. About Delta Air Lines Delta has a longstanding commitment to sustainable air travel and through its inauguralESG reporthighlights its intention to be a catalyst for global change and its role in growing empathy, respect and care for the planet and the people within it. In 2020, it committed to be the first carbon-neutral airline globally. Delta was the No. 1 airline named amongAmerica’s Most Sustainable Companies byBarron’sin 2020. It was the only U.S. airline included in the 2021 S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook. It has received theVision for AmericaAward by Keep America Beautiful and Captain Planet Foundation’sSuperhero Corporate Award.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/sustainable-business-travel/,"Sustainable business travel: good for the environment and business  Sustainable business travel is a growing consideration for businesses around the world, with many organisations setting aggressive carbon-reduction goals across their operations. In 2019, humans produced more than 43 billion tonnes of CO2*. The global aviation industry was responsible for around 2% of those emissions*. When comparing the CO2 emission contributions across different forms of transport, road transport accounts for 74% of CO2 emissions compared to 12% from aviation*. Businesses understand the critical role of face-to-face contact in driving business performance and growth, and are seeking new ways to incorporate sustainability into theirbusiness travel programsto support their overall climate-neutrality goals. Today, businesses have the ability to understand their travel program’s carbon impactandmaintain travel activity in an environmentally responsible way throughstreamlined carbon reporting and access to trusted and accountable carbon-offset programs. There is also a growing commitment across the travel supply chain to define and deliver on sustainable business travel goals for the benefit of the environment.    The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has defined three sustainability objectives for the air transport industry which, they believe, can be achieved through the widespread adoption of improved technologies, low carbon fuels, more efficient aircraft operations, and infrastructure improvements:  In addition to air transport sustainability initiatives, other travel suppliers such as hotels and car rental companies are also actively adopting new technologies and processes to reduce their carbon impact. South Pole Interview Corporate Travel Management (CTM) sat down withLeah Wieczorek, Business Development Manager – AsiaatSouth Pole, a leading project developer and provider of global climate solutions, to discuss ways that businesses and business travellers can drive sustainable business travel in their travel programs and travel behaviour for the better of the environment, their people and their business.  Q. What are the key steps a business should undertake to understand their carbon footprint and establish an effective carbon credit program. A. The first step in understanding your organisation’s emissions is to measure its carbon footprint. Our experienced team of greenhouse gas accountants help companies measure and track their main sources of direct and indirect emissions. From there, you can identify target areas for future emissions reductions. Organisations can compensate for emissions from necessary business activities, such as work travel, by purchasing carbon credits. At South Pole, we have our five-stepClimate Journey, which helps organisations measure, understand and take action to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, including selecting a portfolio of carbon projects that aligns with company values.  Q. What are the general benefits for businesses that choose to offset their carbon footprint? These days, more and more businesses are being asked by stakeholders “What are you doing to take action and address climate change?” This is coming from their shareholders, theinvestment communityandcustomers. Minimising impact on the climate is no longer a nice-to-have, but a business imperative. Understanding and addressing your organisation’s carbon footprint is one concrete and measurable way to help lower global emissions, contribute to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and strengthen your business brand and reputation. On the flipside,notacting to address climate change is increasingly becoming a reputational risk for a company.    Q. What are the most common ways that businesses choose to offset their carbon footprint? And what are the benefits of choosing a carbon project with environmental and social co-benefits? A. Great question. South Pole clients can choose to offset their remaining emissions by choosing carbon credits from a variety of projects — solar, wind, biomass, cookstoves, reforestation and forest protection, and so on — and from a variety of geographies, depending on their business location, values and preferences. For example, an Australian company can choose to offset emissions with carbon credits from projects located in Australia and the greater Asia-Pacific region. Another example is our clientSignify— they support a portfolio of carbon projects aligning with their ‘Brighter lives, better world’ vision. Carbon credits have a dual purpose. The robust monitoring, verification and reporting process that our projects go through ensures theemission reduction is real, measurable, permanent, additional, independently verified and unique. This is done by selecting carbon projects thatmeet international best-practice standards. A company can use these carbon credits to offset their emissions, indirectly supporting these great climate-friendly projects globally. Secondly, the environmental and social co-benefits that carbon projects create alongside emission reductions are an investment multiplier and a great benefit to communities. By one estimate, for every carbon credit (1 tCO2e) purchased from a forestry project,an additional US$242 is createdthrough forest ecosystem services and jobs in agroforestry farming. South Pole’s clients invest in a range of carbon projects that create a broad spectrum of additional benefits, includingprotecting and re-generation of forests,improving lives and livelihoods, generatingnew forms of renewable energyandconverting agricultural waste into bioenergy.    Q. How do carbon-credits work? A. Each carbon credit represents the equivalent of one metric tonne of carbon dioxide (tCO2e) being eitheravoided or removed from the atmosphere. High-quality carbon credits adhere to a strict set of standards. You can check this by ensuring the projects you invest in are registered with a third-party, internationally recognised verification standard, such as theGold Standard, Verra’sVerified Carbon Standard(VCS), or standards verified by theUNFCCC. As well as certifying the legitimacy of a project and its emissions reductions, these standards also help highlight different project co-benefits contributing towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  Q. What shifts in carbon offset program adoption have you seen by businesses and individuals over the past 5-10 years, and why? How does this vary around the world and by industry segment? A. There has been consistent growth in the carbon market for thepast five years, and demand remains high in 2020. Since the Paris Climate Agreement was signed in 2016 — an historic milestone for global climate action — corporate and government buyers of carbon credits have become more sophisticated and interested in understanding the projects and communities they are investing in. As described above, we see clients being very specific in the types of credits that they wish to buy. This is a welcome change that allows the positive impacts of carbon projects to be more widely communicated. Despite the global economic impact of COVID-19, we are still seeing tremendous progress in climate action through major corporate net zero announcements and industry working groups such as the ‘Transform to Net Zero’ alliance founded by A P. Moller – Maersk, Danone, Mercedes-Benz AG, Microsoft, Natura & Co, NIKE, Starbucks, Unilever, Wipro and the Environmental Defense Fund. Carbon markets remain strong, despite economic downturn — and that’s a big change from the carbon market crash that followed the 2007 global financial crisis.    Q. How does South Pole source and report on the global sustainability programs it supports? A. South Pole is a signatory to theUN Global Compactand we provide aSustainability Reportannually to them. In addition, we publish an annualcarbon emissions accounting reportand we disclose which carbon projects we support. Our global carbon reporting is based on South Pole’sclimate neutrallabel criteria which aligns with international best-practice reporting standardPAS 2060, developed in 2014 by the British Standards Institution (BSi). The underlying greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting must follow recognised international standards such as theGHG ProtocolandISO 14064-1. In addition to this, South Pole is a certified B Corporation in Australia and the United States, as well as a certified carbon neutral organisation in Australia under the Federal Government’sClimate Active Standard.  Q. Can you explain the difference between a business’s direct and indirect emissions? And how significant is business travel as a contributing source of indirect emissions compared to other indirect sources? A. Direct emissions are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting entity (business). These include things like company vehicles and energy/heat generation at company facilities. Indirect emissions are emissions that are a consequence of the activities of the reporting entity, but occur at sources owned or controlled by another entity. Business travel — particularly flights — are often the largest single source of indirect emissions for office-based businesses (often making up 80% or more). Globally, aviation accounts foraround 2% of annual emissions.  Q. What sort of climate neutrality goals are airlines setting, who are the best performers and why, and what impact is this having on the environment? A. In late 2019 and early 2020, we saw major airlines leading the corporate climate action movement, with announcements from Qantas, British Airways, Air New Zealand, Etihad and Delta to name a few. Their commitments ranged from announcing carbon neutrality with 100% carbon offset flights, incentivising carbon offset flights via loyalty programs, andbillion dollarcarbon strategies. South Pole is supportive of allaviation climate action, and we work with several airlines to meet the soon-to-be mandatory industry carbon reduction targets under the CORSIA framework.    Q. What sort of travel behaviour can travellers adopt to minimise their carbon footprint when it comes to flying? A. The best way to minimise your carbon footprint in the air is to fly economy class! First and Business class seats on international flights have almost twice the carbon footprint of Economy travel. This is due to the much larger area these passengers are afforded and the extra weight associated with their seating and luggage allowance — as well as other features associated with first and business first or business class travel. Champagne anyone?  Q. What role do hotels play in carbon creation, and what choices can travellers make to reduce their carbon impact through their choice of hotel? A. Hotels are large consumers of energy through lighting, heating and cooling, catering and linen washing facilities. The restaurants in hotels also have a carbon footprint in the supply of food and drinks. Hotels also create a lot of waste through the high turnover of guests and the need to have fully stocked, clean rooms. South Pole has partnerships withHiltonandEarthCheckto work on clean and green conferencing and accommodation solutions. When booking accommodation, ask your hotel provider if they source renewable energy and have responsible consumption policies in place for the consumables used at their hotel. During your stay, you can reduce emissions by:  About South Pole: South Pole is a leading project developer and provider of global climate solutions, with over 350 experts in 18 global offices.

This standard is revolutionising the way that airlines can sell their services to consumers through positioning products and services that best meet the needs of the buyer. As such, airlines are designing their own NDC solutions in ways that work for their business and customers, and each airlines’ offering will vary as it comes to market and evolve over time.

Overview The client, Challenger, is an ASX-listed Australian investment management firm and a CTM client since 2013. Challenger was the first customer to implement CTM’s proprietaryforecasting technology. Objectives Challenger’s key objective was to reduce overall travel costs by improving the buying behaviour of their travellers and travel bookers at the time of booking. The key objectives were to: Challenges Prior to the development of CTM’s advanced forecasting technology, there was no technology available in the corporate travel market purely aimed at influencing buying behaviour prior to  booking by highlighting the best day to travel. With Challengers’ staff dispersed around the country, it was difficult to drive effective booking behaviour day-to-day, meaning inefficiencies were being seen as well as inconsistencies with travel policy adoption. Solutions Challenger was the first client of CTM to implement CTM’s proprietary forecasting technology. These tools allowed travellers and travel arrangers to visualise the optimal day to travel for their desired route across multiple days in a single search – driving efficiency and cost savings to the business. With the application’s user-friendly design and intuitive nature, deployment and take-up of the technology was rapid and required little to no training or persuasion.

Read on to find out how. Overview The client is a national electronics retailer with an annual travel spend of almost $2M. CTM conducted a major review of the company’s travel policy with the aim of reducing travel costs for the business. Objectives The key objectives were to design and implement a new travel policy for the client which would reduce total travel expenditure without impacting on the number of trips taken. The key objectives were to: Challenges Without a formal travel policy in place the client was unable to accurately monitor and analyse their purchasing behaviour against the company’s actual travel needs. This lack of structure presented CTM with a number of challenges which would ultimately determine their ability to meet the client’s objectives. These included: Solutions CTM first needed to fully understand the client’s existing purchasing behaviour compared to their actual travel needs. This was achieved by conducting athree month review of booking and travel trendsto determine the legitimate need for flexible airfares versus the cost-saving opportunities presented by Best Fare of the Day. Based upon the findings of the three month trial, CTM was able to: Results Within the first three months of implementing the new travel policy, the following cost reductions were achieved: Travel spend decreased by 21% ($100k) in 3 months By establishing a needs-driven travel policy based upon actual booking behaviour and trends, the client achievedover $100kin travel savings despite a 10% increase in travel activity. This savingrepresents 42% of the company’s annual travel savings target during the first quarter of implementation. This result was achieved byreducing the company’s over-reliance on expensive fully-flexible fares by 40%and increasing domestic booking lead-in times.

Objectives Coordination of both air and ground transportation was required to support the Government and opposition campaign deliverables. This involved CTM liaising with several suppliers including air, coach charters and the Government’s outsourced accommodation provider. Challenges The majority of travel was requested with a short lead time, so ensuring our dedicated Government team answered calls and responded to emails with urgency was of the essence. VIP stakeholder bookings were high-touch with a premium level of service and strict confidentiality required across the course of the campaign ensuring there was no cross over of travel between the Government and the opposition. Solutions CTM understood that clear communication would be key to delivering a successful and seamless election travel program. In the lead-up, multiple discovery meetings were scheduled with key stakeholders for both Government and the opposition to understand their requirements and expectations. From these meetings, CTM was able to collate and document all information, including key contacts, suppliers, and processes and share it with the applicable parties including the CTM operational and after-hours teams. The CTM after-hours team needed to be briefed to complement and streamline the high level of service no matter what time of day enquiries were made.

Read on to find out how. Overview The evacuation needed to be completed within a limited timeframe along with negotiating sufficient evacuation transportation, including scheduled and charter flights, and emergency accommodation for displaced personnel. Challenges As with any natural disaster, cyclone activity occurs with minimal warning and can escalate or change course at a moment’s notice. The remote working location of many Australian mining sites also presents limitations to land and air transport services, further contributing to the challenges of an emergency evacuation. In managing the relocation of 550+ CITIC Pacific Mining personnel, CTM was faced with the following challenges: Solutions The core elements of CTM’s solution included: Results Successful evacuation of 550+ remote location personnel Through CTM’s successful negotiations with transportation providers, including the rerouting of a scheduled Qantas flight via Paraburdoo, CTM achieved the successful evacuation of all required personnel plus emergency accommodation with 24 hours.

They undertake high volumes of straightforward UK based journeys. Their spend is approximately £350k per annum on rail, flights, accommodation, ferry, meetings and events.  Overview The key objectives were to: • Introduce a competitive fee structure• Increase visibility via management information systems (MIS)• Implement a hotel program• Reduce time to book and process efficiencies. Overall, the main objective was to improve the efficiency of their booking process through consolidation of their travel into an official travel program. Challenges Through initial travel program implementation discussions,Corporate Travel Management (CTM)identified a lack of controls in place surrounding travel and accommodation expenditure management. There was no clear travel policy only generalised ‘custom and practice’ and little management information on actual expenditure. Solutions Through the implementation phase CTM used a structured processes to collect and collate data for creating theonline portaland staff profiles. As the client wanted a system in place as quickly as possible, CTM arranged for the client to begin trading in an offline environment whilst the build of the online portal was completed. Therefore, from contract signing to trading was a matter of two weeks. Once the online system was in place, CTM then undertook a series of face to face training sessions with key bookers. Another key requirement that was identified was the need to review hotel expenditure. It was clear from initial analysis that there was limited visibility on spend. CTM discussed and identified key travel locations and from this could estimate the number of room nights required in these specific areas.

CTM helped establish the framework for one airline’s flight credit rebate process. Read on to learn more. Objectives The global pandemic created a turbulent travel period which resulted in a high volume of tickets on hold. The customer needed a cost effective and seamless solution that would elimate forfeiture of credits. Two options were presented to the customer based on the airline’s ability to accommodate a rebate or flight credit. CTM provided a full analysis of both options, working through a cost and process analysis to present a recommendation. Challenges The significant challenge was the size of the travel program which had a large subset of government agencies. Due to the sheer size of the customer and volume of travel booked, there was an equally high level of tickets on hold with their preferred airline. The options that were available to the customer were a future flight credit or an airline rebate (cash refund). The use of future flight credits came with restrictions including booking classes, the inability to utilise negotiated fares, and applicable fare classes not displaying.

Overview The client is a provider of property management services with an annual travel spend of £800,000. They were looking to move to a managed travel solution, and after a formal negotiation process, CTM was appointed to provide a one-stop shop for all online and offline travel bookings. Objectives Overall, the main objective was to implement a travel program from scratch, that improved the booking experience and delivered a return on investment. The key objectives were to: Challenges Having no existing travel management tools or processes in place, the client required company-wide training to be carried out for over 1,000 staff members. Given the small time window for implementation, the training had to be completed efficiently to allow for a seamless transition period. Solutions Online Booking Tool –Given the client’s requirement for advanced booking functionality, CTM implemented anOBTthat allows them to book all aspects of their travel in one streamlined process – saving time previously spent searching on individual comparison websites. Management reporting– with CTM’s comprehensive management reporting the client has a greater insight into the number and type of bookings that are being made. This not only makes things much easier for the invoicing but allows both parties to be more strategic when trying to further reduce travel costs by encouraging smarter buying behaviours such as switching to off-peak rail tickets. Travel policy creation –Travel policies were embedded within Lightning, which triggers ‘guilt’ screens when the cheapest option isn’t selected for rail and air bookings. Hotel rate caps have been implemented for inside London and several other major cities, and Business and First-class options have been turned off for flights. Training –CTM put together a Traveller Education Programme (that formed part of our implementation plan) to facilitate the onboarding of all travellers. Face-to-face booker engagement workshops on-site at the client’s head office were organised over a 4-day period. There were also ‘follow-up sessions’ which were carried out via the web for anyone that wasn’t able to attend or for those that had any further questions. Testimonial “The [training] sessions were great as they also focused on encouraging the right behaviour and aided smarter buying and looking at travel holistically. The system was simple to put in place and is propelling us forward as a business” - Client Contract Manager - “The booker training/engagement was really beneficial and allowed people to come and ask specific questions.” - Senior Project Manager - Results In just six weeks, CTM was able to fully implement a travel program and policy from scratch, facilitating a seamless transition for the client and all internal stakeholders. During the process, 1,025 travel bookers were loaded into the system with all existing negotiated hotel rates. 1st year savings = £44,905 (Rail = £36,746, Air =£8,159) 2nd year savings = £66,405 (Rail = £61,550, Air £4,855) Online adoption increased by 13% to 98.82% in August 2019 Travel program implementation doesn’t need to be difficult.

Corporate Travel Management (CTM)assisted in the consolidation of the client’s travel program across 39 markets. Read on to find out how. Overview A CTM client in the pharmaceutical space had experienced double-digit growth, adding over 10,000 new employees, and was looking for global consolidation of their travel program with a global mandate across 39 markets. Challenges A global pharmaceutical company had experienced double-digit growth year over year for four years and added over 10,000 new employees. Their travel program was fragmented and lacked transparency, with no global mandate across their 39 markets. The company’s growth amplified its need for better travel forecasting and consistency. Using benchmarking, it was found that their hotel and airline programs were delivering savings in a few key markets; however, they were not implemented globally and were unable to take full advantage of hard-won supplier agreements without consolidated data. The company set out to partner with a TMC that could support their global needs in a way that empowered their local affiliates to take part in the process. Solutions CTM worked closely with the client to accomplish: Phased implementationLocal stakeholders on both sides were brought into the process early to ensure that key influencers were fully engaged and equipped with the bid outcome rationale, including customisable communication plans that would ensure the greatest buy-in for local offices and their travellers. The phased approach gave us the opportunity to build an ever-compelling managed program as more markets went live. Program transparencyThe first step to achieving greater spend visibility and consolidated reporting was to implement globally standardised data requirements. For example, consistent application of trip reason codes made internal benchmarking possible. Standardised consolidatedreportingprovided visibility into areas such as unused air tickets –$1.3 million USD in unused air tickets was reduced to $20,000 USD in the first year. Policy adoptionA new global policy was introduced to balance managing costs and traveller satisfaction.Advance booking of 14+ days is now well over 76% of air purchased. Our global account manager continues to drive adoption by working with local stakeholders to educate and encourage compliance. Consistent serviceWe report on more than 20 performance metrics monthly to deliver on our service level commitment. These metrics are then used to calculate a combined percentage of service quality and consistency.By the close of the first year, every market earned over 96%. Results The client consolidated their program across 39 markets and implemented 89% of the $100 million USD spend.

Business Scope:Global air Air volume:$8.5m USD / $14m globally  Overview As part of our implementation process with a global leader in diversified wound care and regenerative medicine, CTM identified an opportunity to streamline a very labor intensive human resource (HR) data feed process. Challenges The existing process required the client to manually clean profiles after each download. In evaluating best practices, CTM recommended merging data from three separate HR data feeds into one fully automated weekly process. From there, CTM could upload to Concur Travel to manage traveller profiles, new hires, terminations, approval process and provide accurate travel management reporting. Solutions CTM’s Operations Director and Global Account Manager worked closely with the customer and the company’s key stakeholders from each department. Through open discussion on their current process, CTM were able to determine dependencies and opportunities for process improvement. CTM worked with the customer and identified best practices of formatting the employee ID consistently in each data feed as the unique identifier, and removed all the email addresses as a reference item used in duplicate name reconciliation. The goal was to implement a streamlined HR data feed process and eliminate the need for profile clean up after each download. Results CTM’s strategy resulted in the customer downloading over 4,000 profiles of terminated employees prior to the go live date.

https://au.travelctm.com/corporate-travel/case-studies/case-study-fifa-womens-world-cup-2023,"Case Study: FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 CTM Sport joined forces with FIFA as the official travel manager for FIFA staff and referees during the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023. Overview CTM Sport joined forces with FIFA as the official travel manager for FIFA staff and referees during the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023, hosted in Australia and New Zealand. This partnership began in October 2022, with CTM Sport overseeing travel arrangements for the official draw held in New Zealand. This collaboration extended to CTM Sport managing staff travel logistics for the official tournament, which concluded in late August 2023. CTM Sport arranged 277 travel bookings for referees across the nine host cities and assisted with over 5,121 travel bookings for FIFA staff during the tournament. Additionally, CTM Sport’s dedicated team secured substantial savings of $445,000 for FIFA. Objectives The overall goal was to meticulously arrange and manage the travel logistics for FIFA staff members and referees seamlessly throughout the entire tournament, ultimately guaranteeing the delivery of an exceptional customer experience. Challenges Navigating the complexities of arranging travel for a project of this scale requires the experience and expertise of a professional travel management company like CTM Sport. As this year’s tournament was hosted by two countries, facilitating harmonious collaboration was imperative. This required effective coordination amongst the regional teams and precise alignment of internal systems, processes, and protocols. The partnership also required integrating CTM’s technology with FIFA’s internal systems. One of these systems, IFES, which functions as FIFA’s in-house online travel request system, seamlessly linked with the Amadeus online booking tool. During tournament periods, this platform handles an extensive load of over 3,000 air travel arrangements. However, integrating these two systems saw disparities in staff profiles and the distribution of itineraries. Furthermore, FIFA had a strict policy of maintaining the confidentiality of referees’ identities until 10 hours before kick-off. While this strategy effectively prevents corruption and safeguards referees’ anonymity and security, it adds complexity in securing advance travel bookings. Solutions Given the magnitude of this project, a high level of sport travel expertise was required. CTM Sport adeptly navigated the project, overcoming any challenges using agility and a customer-centric approach. Collaboration The collaborative efforts among CTM Sport’s regional teams (APX in New Zealand and CTM Sport in Australia) were instrumental in developing a tailored travel framework and solutions that precisely met FIFA’s unique requirements. Moreover, effective engagement with external stakeholders was pivotal in overcoming challenges. By proactively collaborating with FIFA and Amadeus’s internal teams, CTM Sport swiftly addressed system errors, ensuring the consistency of accurate information across systems and itineraries. Close collaboration with trusted suppliers led to a streamlined process, allowing for swift changes of full names on short notice. Embracing flexibility and a customer-centric mindset empowered CTM Sport to overcome these challenges, guaranteeing the timely delivery of referee tickets. Furthermore, CTM Sport effectively managed ticket reservations for FIFA staff members, even when they initially came with limitations and non-refundable terms. Through adept negotiation, CTM Sport successfully coordinated arrangements that enabled FIFA to secure refunds with only minor associated penalties. Communication CTM Sport maintained consistent and robust communication throughout the tournament through regular weekly calls and comprehensive reporting. This ongoing and proactive dialogue between CTM Sport and FIFA uncovered areas within CTM Sport’s operations that warranted improvement to meet FIFA’s requirements effectively. Leveraging these insights, CTM Sport crafted a framework and streamlined processes within the reservations team, complete with clearly defined task assignments. Onsite Consultant Moreover, during the tournament, CTM ensured the presence of a dedicated consultant in each host country. This onsite representation facilitated swift communication and provided CTM Sport with invaluable insights into the intricacies of FIFA’s operations and its unique environment. These consultants played a vital role as communication channels, promptly relaying areas of concern, enabling CTM Sport to address challenges and minimise potential disruptions to FIFA proactively. Results CTM Sport arranged 277 travel bookings for referees across nine host cities and assisted with over 5,121 travel bookings for FIFA staff during the tournament. Through expert negotiations, the CTM Sport consultants secured substantial savings of $445,000 for FIFA. Overall, the CTM Sport and FIFA WWC 2023 partnership was hugely successful, meeting deadline and budget expectations throughout the tournament and ensuring the seamless transport of FIFA staff and referees.

Solutions CTM Sport Travel Consultants were conscious to retrieve full specifications from travellers with disabilities and/or impairments, including what would be needed on-board/within accommodation and ground transport in advance of booking. Airlines that could accommodate aisle chairs were selected for athletes travelling to the Commonwealth Games and Asia World Cup, with attention paid to ensuring enough aisle spaces would be available for the number of athletes travelling. When athletes required to travel with a sports chair, wheel bags, and/or medical kit as well as a day chair, airlines were advised in advance and uplifted free of charge.

Overview Ahead of the Heineken Champions Cup Semi-Final at the Matmut Atlantique Stadium in Bordeaux, CTM Sport managed the logistics and coordinated and booked all charter flights and accommodation for the Exeter Chiefs Men’s team, their management, and VIPs with charter flights. Challenges With the fixture location only confirmed 20 days before the semi-final kick-off, CTM Sport was faced with a tight turnaround to deliver the right travel solutions for the team travel.  During this short time, CTM Sport needed to source suitable accommodation for 50 people that also had onsite function space for private dining, meeting rooms, and space to set up equipment for physio treatment. In addition, travel from Exeter to Bordeaux posed a significant challenge as there are limited commercial flights and few charter options available resulting from reduced crews. Solutions Specialist preferred partner hotels:CTM Sport leveraged long-standing relationships with preferred hotel suppliers and their specialist sports divisions to locate and secure suitable hotels in Bordeaux. CTM Sport ensured the hotels had experience working with professional sports teams, had enough availability, and were able to hold the space until the location of the fixture was confirmed. Seamless communication for no-delay bookings:CTM Sport established and maintained strong lines of communication with the club, which enabled quick and informed decision-making ensuring their preferred options were secured. Experienced charter brokers:The club was presented with several options and used our expertise to advise them on which would be the best option for their requirements. Flexibility for risk mitigation:Choosing charter flights allowed for a greater level of flexibility when submitting manifests and selecting departure times with changes allowed up to the day of travel. This meant CTM Sport was well-positioned to handle any unforeseen last-minute changes such as injury replacements and could choose the team’s best departure and arrival timings. Results CTM Sportsuccessfully delivered return team travel from Exeter to Bordeaux, allowing the team and management to focus on the most important elements of any major sports competition – nutrition, training, and peak performance for the fixture. Working closely with our preferred suppliers meant we could ensure the final arrangements would be seamless and could guarantee the best possible service for every aspect of the trip. Testimonial Exeter Chiefs could not have picked a better travel management company in CTM and their specialist sporting division CTM Sport to manage our team’s travel to Bordeaux for the Champions Cup Semi-Final.

Our sporting fixtures often come at a minute’s notice and as such we need travel management expertise that can seamlessly coordinate the travel logistics, taking the stress away from the clubs and sporting officials attending.

Since we commenced our partnership with CTM, the high level of customer service we have received has been the most significant change in our travel program. We’ve also benefited from our account manager’s forensic approach to choosing reporting options that best suit our business needs.  We understand that your business travel needs and objectives are unique. What are the elements that you feel make it such, and how does CTM accommodate for those intricacies?

A fragmented approach to booking all travel activity was resulting in inefficiencies and missed savings. Overview Origin Energy’s corporate and site travel was fragmented, with separate projects managing their flight, coach and accommodation requirements with no central coordination or visibility. An opportunity was identified to integrate travel teams, processes, procedures andbooking tools, thereby increasing automation to ensure maximum benefit was achieved through booking preferred suppliers and recognising significant cost savings. Challenges At the peak, Origin Energy had multiple operators for charter flights, coaches and numerous autonomous camps with 3000 beds across regional Queensland. Origin Energy is partnered with CTM for its corporate travel requirements, including commercial airline bookings, accommodation, and car in rental, in addition to ancillary services such as after-hours assistance, visa processing, reporting and strategic Account Management. Site travel continued to be managed separately via their People Logistics team leading to inefficient processes, booking behaviour and missed cost savings. Solutions An opportunity was identified to merge the two teams (CTM Travel Consultants and the People Logistics team), processes, procedures, and bookings tools, thereby increasing automation, and ensuring benefits realised through preferred suppliers resulting in significant cost savings.

Since partnering withCorporate Travel Management(CTM), the client’s online adoption has increased from almost no online adoption at all (0%) to 95%. Read on to find out how. Overview The client is a large trade union in the UK with an annual travel spend of £700,000. Most of its members work in the UK government and other public bodies and require travel to the union’s conferences and events around the country. Objectives The main objective was to improve the efficiency of the client’s travel program with increased online adoption and offline support for conference and events travel. The key objectives were to: Challenges As the client’s travellers were employees of various companies, many of the bookers already had profiles with CTM that were associated with different accounts. This meant that for the client’s large-scale conferences, travel for a high number of delegates had to be booked on an individual basis, which allowed countless room for error. Solutions Online booking tool for smaller group travel– The client’s regular travel was feasible for an online booking solution, so CTM implemented theLightning OBT. The tool’s intuitive design meant that the transition was seamless, however training was also provided to iron out any creases. New travel policy for user profiles– Given that many bookers had existing user profiles from their current jobs, strict guidelines had to be put in place to ensure that bookings were made using the correct channel. It was decided that only personal emails were to be used for the union-specific travel, so an approval process was set up for bookers to only allow bookings made from personal email addresses. Offline booking form for large conferences and events– For large events with up to 900 attendees (such as the client’s Annual Conference in Brighton), an offline booking form was provided to delegates who emailed or posted back on completion. This offline method enabled CTM to book individual travel without constant back and forth and minimised room for error, with an offline team available to assist 24/7. Results Online adoption reached 95% Since partnering with CTM, the client’s online adoption has increased from almost no online adoption at all (0%) to 95%, with an average of 80% over the past year. Cost per mile reduced to £0.41, nearly 25% lower than the corporate average £383,215 saved in total from travel policy configurations £343,689 was due to changing buyer behaviour to book rail in advance and choosing off-peak tickets Eager to improve your business’s online adoption?

As part of our continuous improvement planning strategy for our client, CTM conducted a study to assess if hard stop pre-trip approvals on airfare reduced cost and guided compliant employee behaviour. Challenges Travellers were frustrated with hard stop approval processes as many times their submitted trips were delayed in receiving approval from managers. As a result, travellers had to repeat the process only to find airfares had increased. The challenges were identified on more than 10,000 trips issued out of North America: Solutions CTM conducted a study to assess if hard stop approvals were inflating travel costs and negatively impacting employee productivity and program satisfaction.

https://au.travelctm.com/corporate-travel/case-studies/case-study-cost-savings-mining/,"CASE STUDY: Cost Savings CTM delivers 25% cost savings despite increased travel activity. CTM worked with it’s mining client to deliver a refined travel policy which would achieve cost savings without diminishing the travel experience. Read on to find out how. Overview The client is a large Australian mining company with operations in the Bowen Basin. As part of the company’s mining operations, employees regularly travelled between Brisbane and Emerald on commercial airlines. CTM implemented a new initiative to reduce the unnecessary use of flexible airfares, thereby reducing the client’s total spend on this frequently travelled route. Objectives CTM was tasked with reducing the client’s corporate travel costs without impacting the reliability or comfort of the travel experience. Specifically, CTM’s objectives were to:• Reduce the number of flexible fares booked by travel bookers.• Reduce the travel costs of employees flying between Brisbane and Emerald. Challenge CTM needed to overcome several challenges to successfully reach the client’s objectives without inciting a negative response from travellers or travel bookers. These included:•Procedures:Travellers communicated directly with travel bookers about ticket preferences, which allowed them to decide the type of fare that they wanted to book.•Company culture:Travel bookers followed the instructions of travellers when they requested flexible fares, without encouraging them to book cheaper fixed fares.•Attitudes:Travellers preferred flexible fares over fixed fares due to the increased flexibility these presented, despite the extra costs incurred. Solutions To address these challenges, CTM focused on engaging travel bookers and shifting employee attitudes. Through a quarterlyreportingframework, CTM discovered a high number of travellers were booking flexible fares but were not regularly changing their flights. CTM identified this as a primary opportunity for cost-reduction, as these fares were high-cost but low-value for the client. Through this discovery, CTM engaged directly with the travel bookers and highlighted the cost versus value issue of booking flexible fares. Instead of following the directions of individual travellers, travel bookers were asked to discourage travellers from booking flexible fares and consider fixed fares. Results Travel costs reduced by 25% Prior to CTM’s program review, the client had a 60 per cent uptake of flexible fares across approximately 1,200 sectors. Through our initiative to reduce the use of flexible fares, the totaltravel spend was reduced by 25 per centwith a marked decline in the use of flexible fares (down 26 per cent). This cost reduction was possible despite the addition of100 extra sectors flownand aconsistent number of booking changesover the same reported period, proving that flexible fares did not deliver best value for the client. CTM’s extensive experience in the travel industry allowed the client to achieve additional savings and an enhanced return on investment. Through this partnership, CTM successfully changed the company’s travel culture and significantly improved the client’s bottom line without sacrificing the travel experience of its employees.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/travel-risk-management-riskline-interview/,"Behind the scenes in Travel Risk Management (TRM): A Riskline interview  Ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of a travel risk management platform? Who decides what constitutes a ‘risk’? How are risks identified, verified and categorised? How are they channeled to the relevant travellers in a timely and reliable manner? We sat down withRisklinefounder and CEO, Kennet Nordlien,to discuss the processes behind the risks we receive, how to measure an ROI on travel risk management, which events and technologies are transforming the travel risk management landscape, and the steps your business can take to ensure a robust and reliable duty of care framework for your employees and travellers.  Q. How many alerts does Riskline communicate every year? Is this growing? If so, why? A. Through our strategic partnerships, we serve 10+ million travellers annually. On average we issue between 20,000 – 21,000 alerts annually. However, YTD for 2020 we have issued over 24,000 alerts (as of 15 October). Without a doubt, this increase was due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the extraordinary travel measures and restrictions implemented by countries around the world. The majority of alerts we publish are proactive, and communicate upcoming safety and travel disruption intelligence pertaining to upcoming protests, transport or labour strikes, extreme weather events, and of course, new COVID-19 measures.  Q. What tools and technologies do you use to monitor and verify risk events globally? A. We work as a geographically distributed team. Today we operate in over 15 countries and across 11 different time zones. Our analysts monitor hundreds of thousands of open source intelligence (OSINT) 24/7/365 to make accurate and timely assessments of travel and public safety risks. We employ several tools to aid our analysts in finding the right information at the right time, includingRiskline Monitor: our custom-built aggregator tool for finding the most important travel and security news and information, which allows us to monitor developments in multiple languages and adjust parameters for the latest crisis;AI Monitor: a third-party artificial intelligence platform to uncover breaking news faster than any human could.  Q. How are risks categorised? A. All Riskline Alerts and Notices are assigned one of seven categories: The category is selected based on the root cause, motivation or, in some cases, the outcome of the reported event.    Q. What accuracy and timeliness measures are in place? A. All our analysts complete internal and third-party OSINT training programs, which include instruction on media and event verification, especially for user-generated content (UGC). We ensure information is verified by several sources and that each Alert is reviewed by a second, and more senior analyst. While our verification process involves multiple steps, we typically publish Alerts in less than 10 minutes from our analysts first being notified of an incident taking place.  Q. What changes have you seen in business demand for formal travel risk management tools in the past 5 years? A. Duty of Care has become increasingly important over the past 5 years, evolving from a ‘nice to have’ add-on to an essential part of any travel program. The 2015 Paris Attacks and subsequent terrorist incidents and unprecedented political events like the 2016 Turkish coup attempt were definite catalysts for businesses to demand TRM systems. During this time, TRM tools have transitioned from living solely in security operation centres to a conventional piece of officetechnologyused to oversee travellers and personnel. Demand for traveller tracking and apps that allow for two-way communication have also recently increased.  Q. What are the typical triggers for businesses when choosing to implement a formal TRM solution / tool? A. Once a business has faced significant disruption and/or financial impact due to something going wrong within their travel program, they will quickly want to adopt a TRM solution to ensure it doesn’t happen again. For many businesses, this may have been the wave of terror events in Europe during 2015-2017, and for others the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered this more recently.    Q. What are the key considerations for businesses when looking to implement a formal travel risk management solution? A. Take the time to review your existing travel program, any risk assessments and travel and expense analytics. Not every business will need a highly robust, end-to-end travel risk management solution that covers the globe, while others will require more entry-level basics. Cost consideration will often be tied into this; however, budget solutions do exist for small and mid-market organisations. Seek out solutions that cover not only your travellers, but all your employees. The pandemic has had a fundamental change on business operations, and you will want to meet your Duty of Care obligations for your remote working staff as well as those travelling short distances. Be aware that your solution must be inclusive of your diverse workforce – not all employees are the same and neither is their risk profile. Your risk management solution should meet the need to be accessibly friendly and serve your female, LGBTQ+ and BIPOC staff. Ensure your risk management solution is fully integrated across all travel operation processes, including approval and compliance, and confirm that your employees are fully aware of the policies.  Q. How can businesses best quantify an ROI on their investment in 3rdparty risk management tools? A. It can be best quantified a few key ways:    Q. What are the potential risks / costs for businesses that donotadopt a formal travel risk management solution? A. Duty of Care isn’t solely a moral obligation. Some may forget that it’s also a legal requirement and can come with far-reaching legal ramifications. At the high-stakes end, consider the financial costs of needing a spur-of-the-moment process to extract personnel from a life-threatening situation. Or the smaller expenses that financially add up when trips are disrupted by routine, and often avoidable, events like adverse weather or transport strikes that come with pre-planning notice. Over time businesses may even lose qualified personnel because of the lack of support. We’ve seen time and time again that business travellers expect their employer to provide pre-trip briefings and during-trip support to them.  Q. What are the most effective ways for travel managers and business travellers to consume risk information? A. To be forewarned is forearmed. It’s essential for travel managers and business travellers to have immediate access to pre-trip intelligence like pre-travel advisories, upcoming notices of events and more granular city risk reports. However, we can’t forget the importance of having in-trip intelligence as well; most travellers are exposed to the greatest amount of risk during their trip. The fast-changing regulatory environment of the COVID-19 pandemic has also shown us that travel managers and travellers need to have the right information available to them even before the trip has booked – during the ‘search’ phase.  Q. What is the difference between Riskline Country Risk Levels and a Government’s risk / safety alert service? A. The methodology behind our Risk Level assessment is based on best practices from internationally recognised risk management procedures. When assessing risk, our analysts take into consideration the actual or potential impact of the threat or hazard they are reporting as well as the likelihood of that threat or hazard taking place, if it has not already. We assess several key components – including the political stability of the country, terrorism, unrest, crime levels, environmental and health concerns as well as threats to personal safety – when establishing the overall Country Risk Level. Our Country Risk Levels can be used by any organisation with an international outlook. On the other hand, a Government’s own risk advisories are used to communicate safety and security concerns to their own citizens. In some cases, there can be political and/or economic motives behind their advisories warning against travel. Some governments use 3, 4, or 5 risk level ratings that do not always leave room for nuance. Governments can also advise their own citizens differently, leading to more confusion.    Q. How did COVID-19 change the travel risk management landscape? A. We have seen disruptions to international travel before but nothing like this prolonged crisis. Suddenly focused shifted from traditional travel risks to trying to navigate a slew of new travel restrictions and measures put in place in response to the pandemic. The world may have temporarily stopped travelling, but the demand for access to immediate travel risk intelligence only increased. What we noticed were shifting priorities, with travel/security managers and HR personnel tasked with supporting the mobility of their workforce from home. A greater emphasis has now been placed on preparedness, pre-trip planning, health assessments, and assistance. Duty of Care is no longer a ‘nice to have’ addition, but crucial to a successful business travel program – and intelligence is its backbone. As domestic and regional travel briefly resumed over the summer months, we saw the importance of granular, localised risk intelligence to any travel program. Country-level risk data is no longer enough to make critical decisions – with local governments mandating their own COVID-19 restrictions, managers and travellers need to know what is happening at the state, city and even neighbourhood level. Traveller tracking has also now become increasingly the norm. For years business travel managers have known that travellers are not always where their PNR or itinerary says they are and locating travellers during the height of the pandemic proved difficult for many corporations. Location-based monitoring of staff by GPS tracking devices and other apps will likely give peace of mind to both the manager and employee.  Q. What new technologies / features are being developed in relation to COVID-19 to support safer travel? A. Better tracking, communication and trip monitoring technology. We see this already with the development of new track and trace applications.  Q. How do you believe clients will be consuming risk data in the coming 5 years? A. In short, everywhere and more easily. I can foresee Duty of Care becoming regulated and mandated by governments, becoming as much as a basic requirement as insurance. There will be no difference between a traveller and in-office or remote-based staff, as all will be entitled to know what is happening around them, from demonstrations and strikes to incidents of crime and dangerous weather conditions. Risk data will be leveraged and integrated into more tools than before.   About Riskline Riskline is a world-class travel risk intelligence company.

https://au.travelctm.com/news/ctm-trading-at-top-of-profit-guidance-after-record-1h-growth/,"24 February 2017 CTM trading at top of profit guidance after record 1H growth  Corporate Travel Management (CTM, ASX Code: CTD) has today reported record half-year results, indicating it is trading at the top of its previous guidance, at $97 million, after achieving strong organic growth in each of its domestic and international markets. The result was accompanied by strong cash flows across the group and growth in new clients across all regions, with underlying net profit after tax, excluding acquisition amortisation, up 55 per cent at $27.3 million. CTM Managing Director and founder Jamie Pherous said that, despite the impacts of airline ticket price cuts and a falling $A, CTM continued to provide earnings certainty for its investors. “Strong organic growth underpinned our first-half EBITDA performance, resulting in underlying profit growth. Excluding acquisitions, this was up 29 per cent over the same period last year,” he said. CTM’s global operations continued to grow, recording $1.87 billion in total transaction value (TTV), which was up 9 per cent, with revenues up 26 per cent due to transactional growth from client wins. “TTV can be a misleading indicator in CTM’s business, as this was significantly affected by steep ticket price declines, especially in Asia, and negative FX movements to the $A,” he said. “CTM have said all along that transactional volume growth, not ticket prices, is the driver of CTM revenue. Lowering ticket prices is an excellent outcome for our clients that we proactively encourage.” Mr Pherous said that, despite the currency depreciation and the effects of the US election on the economy, North America was now CTM’s biggest profit contributor, with underlying EBITDA up 254 per cent. “CTM’s top two performing regions by growth percentage were in the world’s largest developed economies of North America and Europe, with the US now the largest single contributor in both revenue and profit,” Mr Pherous said. “CTM continues to strengthen its position by leveraging our technology suite, delivering a return on investment to clients and creating new areas for expansion.” Mr Pherous said CTM’s record operating cash conversion reflected the continued success of its business model, with underlying earnings per share growing 51 per cent (excluding amortisation from acquisition accounting), demonstrating the company’s ability to successfully integrate acquisitions. “From the beginning, we have always been clear that acquisitions must strengthen our business, align with our client-focused culture, and share the same value proposition,” he said. “All acquisitions are contributing positively to the group – including our most recent additions of Redfern Travel in the UK and Andrew Jones Travel here in Australia – demonstrating our ability to integrate newly acquired businesses and increase market share through CTM’s proven strategy.” Mr Pherous said CTM had now established a global footprint in all its primary markets, with 65 per cent of profits derived offshore. “We will continue to focus on winning market share by combining local experience with industry-leading technology and are expecting a strong second half this financial year,” he said. The CTM Board has declared an interim fully franked dividend of 12.0 cents per share, to be paid on 12 April, 2017. About Corporate Travel Management –click here"

December, which is typically the lowest activity month in the first half, was the highest monthly revenue at $17.3m including the T&T contribution. North America was the largest region in Group revenue and new client wins. CTM’s increased scale in North America through the T&T acquisition and proprietary technology offering, combined with the Group’s financial strength, have driven an acceleration in new client wins.  The Australia/New Zealand region reported underlying EBITDA profit of AU$3.0m for the first half, including AU$1.9m in December 2020 when domestic Australian borders re-opened. This result was achieved on revenue representing only 29% of 1H20, highlighting the capacity of the business to operate profitably on domestic travel.  The Europe region delivered a resilient revenue performance, despite ongoing pandemic restrictions. After new client wins, the region reached break-even in January and is expected to become profitable from February 2021.  CTM grew market share in Asia and has been able to acquire client books with no capital outlay, as competitors exited the travel industry.  Integration of strategic acquisitions on track The acquisition of T&T was completed on 30 October 2020 and integration of T&T is on track. With its strong balance sheet, CTM is expected to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic in a position of strength with enhanced opportunities for organic growth in North America.  CTM also completed the acquisition of Sydney-based travel technology company, Tramada Holdings on 29 October 2020.  Continued technology investment The Group has continued to invest in its technology platform with capex nearing pre-pandemic levels, focused on traveller wellbeing, risk management, safety and hygiene information and budget optimisation tools.  CTM’s ability to leverage its proprietary technology to rapidly respond to changing client needs during the pandemic has been an important factor in growing market share in the reporting period.  Outlook Mr Pherous said, “Whilst Australia and New Zealand have not commenced their vaccination programmes, USA and UK are well advanced. The UK (population 67m) has surpassed 15m vaccinations and the USA (population 329m) has surpassed 50m vaccinations. Both countries expect to have the high-risk segment of their populations vaccinated in this quarter, potentially allowing a relaxation in travel restrictions, much earlier than ANZ. Given 70% of our pre-COVID revenue is derived from the UK and USA, we are well positioned for the incremental revenue gains from travel relaxations in these markets.”  -ENDS-  For further information Media enquiries: Alasdair Jeffrey, Rowland –alasdair.jeffrey@rowland.com.au/ +61 404 926 768 About Corporate Travel Management –click here"

https://au.travelctm.com/news/corporate-travel-management-returns-to-profitability-recovery-underway/,"18 August 2021 CTM returns to profitability – recovery underway  Leading global travel management company,Corporate Travel Management(CTM) returns to profitability in the fourth quarter of the year ended 30 June 2021, led by the Group’s increasing exposure to North America and Europe where pandemic recovery momentum is growing. CTM today announced earnings for the year ended June 2021, posting a AU$13.6m June quarter underlying EBITDA profit, representing a AU$19.1m turnaround on the previous quarter. Positive second half underlying EBITDA of AU$8.1m helped reduce the Group’s underlying EBITDA loss to AU$7.3m for the full year. After the acquisition of Travel and Transport (T&T) in November 2020, CTM is now estimated to be the world’s fourth largest global travel management company and will be a much larger business post-COVID. North America and Europe currently generate close to 80% of Group revenue after market share gains for CTM in these key markets, compared to 72% of pre-COVID 2019 revenue. Managing Director, Jamie Pherous said the company’s value proposition of expert service, leadingtechnologyand measurable return on investment is increasingly relevant for businesses in the current complex travel environment, driving the market share gains. “We returned to positive underlying profit in the second half because of a rapid turnaround in fourth quarter activity in North America and Europe. These regions have made significant progress in vaccine roll-outs and reopening the economy, which gives us reason to be optimistic about FY22. “We continue to see encouraging signs that momentum is building in these regions. July 2021 has delivered a record revenue result post-COVID. “We have successfully integrated the T&T team into the CTM business, and aligning our operating culture, strategic vision and client focus has allowed us to capitalise on the rebound in travel activity and grow our exposure to the world’s largest travel market,” Mr Pherous said. CTM finished the year with no debt and cash of AA$99.0m. Given the strong balance sheet and the recovery of the business, CTM is targeting a return to dividend payments in calendar 2022. Momentum across key regions of North America and Europe North America was CTM’s largest region in the financial year in terms of both Group revenue and other income (AU$96.0m) and new client wins. The region’s rapid recovery meant June quarter revenues grew 47% versus the March quarter, resulting in a return to underlying EBITDA of AU$4.9m in the last quarter. This revenue momentum continued into July, defying a typical summer vacation slow down. Revenue and other income of AU$42.0m in Europe was delivered by a combination of project wins, logistics clients, and ongoing essential travel, despite the lockdown in the UK during the second half. Domestic travel is quickly recovering in the UK, and the trend is expected to accelerate across Europe after the summer vacation. Thanks to a strong AU$12.3m contribution in the second half, CTM Europe turned a first half loss into an underlying AU$10.1m EBITDA profit for the full year. The lucrative Transatlantic and intra-European segments are opening or expected to re-open in the first half of the year to June 2022 and should materially contribute to Group revenue and profitability in both regions. CTM’s Australia / New Zealand region remained profitable, reporting revenue and other income of AU$42.0m and underlying EBITDA of AU$7.7m, despite continued border closures. Lockdowns and the closure of Sydney as a travel hub are limiting the national recovery. Despite this, the AU/NZ business remains resilient, experiencing strong recovery in volumes when border restrictions have been lifted, with domestic travel activity in New Zealand currently over 150% of pre-COVID levels. The trading environment in the Asia region remains challenging because of the reliance on international travel. While CTM is growing market share in Asia, the region is expected to remain marginally loss-making until planned travel bubbles are opened. CTM expects the rebound in corporate travel to continue, forecasting underlying EBITDA for the Group to be positive for the three months to September 2021 and building in the following quarter as North America, the United Kingdom and Europe return to work after summer vacation. -ENDS- For further information Media enquiries: Alasdair Jeffrey, Rowland –alasdair.jeffrey@rowland.com.au/ +61 404 926 768 About Corporate Travel Management –click here"

The acquisitions of multi-award-winning travel management company Chambers Travel and respected Diplomat Travel are in line with CTM’s strategic plan to establish a strong base in the UK and European markets and continue to expand in North America. The acquisitions are expected to be earnings per share accretive in FY2015 and will be funded by a fully underwritten Entitlement Offer of fully paid ordinary shares to eligible shareholders at $8.80 led by Morgans Corporate Limited. The acquisitions are targeted to take effect from January 2, 2015 and will contribute approximately $4 million earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) over six months trading to CTM’s 2015 annual results. CTM Managing Director, Jamie Pherous, said the Board expected the Company’s 2015 EBITDA guidance to be above $45 million based on the new acquisitions plus CTM Group’s initial guidance of more than $41 million, to be refined after the 2015 half year results.

https://au.travelctm.com/news/ctm-celebrates-20-years-in-business/,"19 May 2014 CTM Celebrates 20 Years in Business 1994, petrol cost 60c a litre and Forest Gump was a hit at the box office but more importantly, a legacy was born. On this day in a diminutive office in the Brisbane CBD, with a team of just two, a young Jamie Pherous opened the doors to the first Corporate Travel Management office. With a vision of offering the market a fresh and innovative alternative, Jamie and his team set out with a steely determination to build a business renowned for providing a highly personalised service, developing innovative and flexible client solutions and a commitment to demonstrating a positive return on investment for our services. Fast forward 20 years and it’s these same principles which underpin everything CTM does. CTM now employs over 2000 staff across 37 cities in 15 countries with Jamie still at the helm as Managing Director. A successful listing on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2010 means the company has grown to become one of the largest privately owned travel management companies in Australia and continues to expand across the globe.Jamie attributes the company’s success to a number of things but there’s one which stands alone as the cornerstone. Our people. “The passion of our people is unrelenting and their commitment to being better at what we do every year even after two decades continues to impress me on a daily basis”. A key figure in CTM’s rise, CEO Laura Ruffles reflects on her time with the company. “True partnerships with our customers and staff are the driving force behind our success. The innovation that has been present from day one still burns strong and we aren’t afraid to constantly create and provide better solutions and tools for our customers and teams.” Andre Moten, GM of Australia joined the company in its early years. Like a proud dad, he looks back on how far CTM has come. “CTM will always hold a special place in my memory because of the wonderful culture that has evolved within the business. I have long since held the view that being a growth company with a strong value proposition has brought a diverse array of talent and experience to CTM. The organisation has done particularly well in embracing the diverse talent and views of our people to develop strong points of differentiation in the market. This is key to our success in my opinion.” “CTM has always been prepared to try new things. Not all of which have necessarily gone the way we planned. However, that spirit of entrepreneurialism and “having a go” has been fundamental to our progress, and indeed has been a cornerstone to our approach in redefining the industry within which we live.” So it is with enormous pride that today we celebrate 20 years of business and thank everyone who has been involved in helping CTM become the business it is. We look towards the coming years with complete positivity and determination to deliver on the promises the business was founded on. And what of the original Brisbane office? It now serves as a store room to our larger premise next door and a constant reminder of CTM’s humble beginnings. About Corporate Travel Management –click here"
https://au.travelctm.com/news/yalari-sponsorship/,"CTM and Virgin Australia announce joint sponsorship of Yalari scholarship program for Indigenous children. In mutual commitment towards investing in the education of Indigenous Australians, Corporate Travel Management (CTM) and Virgin Australia have today announced a joint sponsorship deal with Yalari – a non-for-profit organisation that works with Indigenous children from regional and remote communities. The CTM and Virgin Australia Yalari Sponsorship will provide financial support for Yalari to achieve its mission to be one of Australia’s great enduring educational and leadership foundations empowering Indigenous people. The $50,000 investment will make a meaningful difference to Yalari’s cohort of 248 students as they attend some of Australia’s leading boarding schools. The Yalari scholarships also provide students with a robust support network for educational, personal and cultural purposes, with access to dedicated Student Support Officers. Founding Director of Yalari, Waverley Stanley AM, shared: “There are so many ways people can support Yalari, in-kind, through business, and by financial generosity. We’re excited about this new partnership with CTM and Virgin, as travel is an imperative and important part of our children’s lives, with some needing to catch three flights just to get to school each term. Their safety and comfort are our priority, so I’m grateful for our new working partnership with CTM, and proud of the joint support of CTM and Virgin.” CTM’s CEO Australia and New Zealand, Greg McCarthy, shared: “As an Australian-founded and headquartered organisation, CTM recognises our responsibility to give back to the Indigenous Australian community by investing in their future. With a strong business focus in training and education, supporting a scholarship program to provide greater opportunities for schooling felt like the perfect alignment.” “Partnering with our valued supplier, Virgin Australia, makes this program even more rewarding.” Virgin Australia Chief People Officer, Lisa Burquest, said: “Virgin Australia is committed to supporting equitable opportunities and outcomes for First Nations peoples and is pleased to be partnering with CTM to sponsor this scholarship program as part of our reconciliation efforts together.”  About Virgin Australia Founded in the year 2000 by Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Australia is now one of the largest Australian airlines operating an extensive domestic network as well as short-haul international services, charter and cargo operations, and its loyalty program, Velocity Frequent Flyer. The Group employs more than 7,000 people and has been a competitor in the Australian aviation landscape for 23 years. Virgin Australia boasts more than 11.5 million Velocity members who can use their Points to redeem flights to over 500 destinations around the world through Virgin Australia and the airline’s extensive list of international partner carriers.  About Yalari Since 2005, Yalari has been providing Indigenous children from regional and remote communities across Australia the opportunity to receive a full boarding school scholarship for their entire secondary education. Yalari partners with 19 of Australia’s leading boarding schools and has offered scholarship opportunities to 784 Indigenous children. About Corporate Travel Management –click here"
https://au.travelctm.com/news/give-back-for-national-reconciliation-week/,"Give back for National Reconciliation Week Every year, Yalari founder Waverly Stanley AM and his wife managing director Llew Mullins, travel to regional and remote communities to meet promising First Nations Year 6 students and offer them a place at a leading boarding school. They sit at kitchen tables, in lounge rooms, and on back verandahs talking to mothers, fathers, and relatives of the students as the bright-eyed 11- and 12-year-olds listen to what a Yalari scholarship means, and the commitment needed to see it through. For many First Nations children living in regional and remote communities, corporate sponsorship provides a valuable lifeline to educational opportunities others take for granted. As Australia marks National Reconciliation Week until 3 June,Corporate Travel ManagementCEO Australia and New Zealand Greg McCarthy said corporate sponsorships were an opportunity to give back to the Indigenous Australian community. “Supporting important programs like Yalari, Cowboys House and Moorditj Yorga enables our business to support the lives and wellbeing of Indigenous Australians across the country,” Mr McCarthy said. “These partnerships also provide CTM employees with valuable insight and an ongoing education into the challenges facing Australia’s First Nations people, by supporting our corporate commitments to building a more inclusive community and workplace.” A recently announced corporate sponsorship deal with CTM and Virgin Australia will make a meaningful difference to Yalari’s cohort of 248 students, as long-distance travel is often the only way they can attend boarding school. Yalari, which means “child” in the Birra Gubba language of North Queensland, provides First Nations children from regional and remote communities full secondary school boarding scholarships. Ms Mullins said Yalari did more than provide a quality education. “We liaise with the family, the school, tutors, and Indigenous communities to ensure our scholarship recipients have every opportunity to grow up happy, healthy, well-rounded young people to become future leaders and change-makers of their communities and Australia,” Ms Mullins said. “Securing corporate sponsorships can be challenging because there are so many deserving organisations doing impactful work with a limited amount of funds.” Cowboys Community Foundation CEO Fiona Pelling acknowledged the funding challenges, and said they needed to double the current investment each year in order to sustain their current programs and services. Cowboys House is a unique boarding facility for young First Nations and Torres Strait Islander children attending partner schools in Townsville. The organisation also runs Cowboys Try for 5! – an inter-school challenge designed to address the impact of students missing foundation learning in the primary years through poor school attendance. Ms Pelling said each student’s needs were unique. “In addition to government funding and fundraising, we have a gap in excess of $10,000 per student, per year to provide a full service,” Ms Pelling said. “This includes uniforms, nutritious meals, extra-curricular activities, cultural programs, creative and visual arts, a music program, health and wellbeing, tutoring, driving lessons, career support and more. “Our year 13 and 14 Transitions program provides semi-support while these young people settle into employment, further education and training, find safe and affordable accommodation, manage their budgets, and work towards independence in adult life.” Indigenous education support opportunities also extend to making a university or tertiary education more accessible to First Nations people. In Western Australia, the Moorditj Yorga Scholarship Program (MYS) at Curtin University supports mature-aged Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women to enter university, pass their studies and receive mentoring as they transition into their careers. Moorditj yorga means “strong woman” in the Noongar language of Western Australia’s southwest. CTM’s corporate sponsorship has supported five yorgas in their higher education pursuits, with two who recently graduated and three on their higher education journey. Recent graduate Renna Gayde completed her Bachelor of Social Work at Curtin University via the Moorditj Yorga Scholarship Program. “I never believed that I’d go to university, but it’s proven to be an investment in myself, my children and my community,” Ms Gayde said. “I am a Walbunja woman from the Yuin Nation. Gaining the scholarship increased my confidence and validated that I was on the right path.” Ms Mullins said Yalari was currently seeking sponsors for their 2025 intake, with approximately 15 scholarships still requiring funding. Yalari receives 50 per cent of its funding from the Federal Government, but relies heavily on philanthropic contributions from corporate Australia, trusts and foundations, individual donors, and fundraising events to help meet the remaining cost of their operations and programs. “We also have an audacious goal to raise enough funds to allow Yalari to operate in perpetuity,” Ms Mullins said. “The Yalari Foundation was set up to establish a corpus that will allow us to generate sufficient investment income to provide a perpetual source of funding.” To sponsor a child requires a commitment of $20,000 per year which covers tuition and boarding costs from years 7-12. There are many ways to support Yalari – via a student scholarship, or a pathways (university) scholarship, or through a contribution to support Yalari’s holistic student support program, or alumni leadership development.

Approximately one-third of CTM Australia’s customers said that sustainability will be a top priority for their business and travel program in 2022, in a recent global customer survey1. In response, CTM has released a range of new sustainable business travel solutions in 2022 that allow customers to calculate, compare and offset the carbon emissions of their air travel, hotel and car rental choices. CTM’s proprietary online booking tool, Lightning now gives customers the ability to compare carbon calculations per travel segment (air, hotel and car rental), alongside additional sustainability features (including NABERS hotel ratings), and select those with lower environmental impact. Feature enhancements in Lightning also enable travel bookers to offset their itinerary’s carbon emissions either at the time of booking or end of the month, with the option to utilise CTM’s Climate+ program or the customer’s own verified carbon offset partner. CTM’s fully integrated solution means offsetting functionality is available for both offline and online bookings, including carbon footprint display, offsetting costs, invoicing, itineraries, and reporting. CTM AU/NZ CEO, Greg McCarthy said, “Knowing that our customers care about environmental sustainability, it was important for our teams to develop a solution that allowed for environmentally responsible travel without reducing their ability to connect with customers, employees and supply chain. “Despite the pressures of the pandemic, we have continued to invest in developing our proprietary travel technology on behalf of our customers. By owning our own product roadmap, our teams can quickly develop and deploy new and enhanced solutions for our customers based on their direct feedback and needs. “We build our technology from our Sydney-based Tech Hub and engage our customers throughout the development process via our CTM UserLabs, so we know we’re delivering meaningful solutions that meet the local needs of our customers and market.” These latest sustainability features extendCTM’s Climate+ programwhich provides businesses with critical tools and solutions to better understand and minimise the environmental impact of their travel.

https://au.travelctm.com/news/business-travellers-unwind-in-the-clouds/,"24 September 2015 Business travellers unwind in the clouds It’s cloud computing but not as we know it, with a new survey showing Australia’s frequent flyers are some of the most connected users of mobile devices. A Corporate Travel Management (CTM) client survey of some of Australia’s largest companies found more than 20 per cent of business travellers carry three or more mobile devices, but most take the opportunity to switch off from work when in the sky. The CTM research results showed mobile device usage among business travellers is higher than the general public, with research from the Australian Communication and Media Authority finding 48 per cent of Australians have a smart phone. CTM Chief Marketing and Technology Officer Tom Clark said the survey provided valuable information for the company by revealing how customers choose to spend their travel time. “We found corporate travellers are using their devices in flight, but rather than catching up on work, technology is being used to help de-stress and chill out (25.35 per cent vs 64.04 per cent),” Mr Clark said. “This supports previous feedback that business people, who increasingly are expected to be constantly connected and contactable, use flights as one of the only opportunities they have to unplug.” Confirming pre-departure travel information (87.02 per cent) and connecting with family and friends while away from home (84.03 per cent) were the top reasons for using mobile phones, laptops and tablets during business travel, with work duties at the destination coming in a close third (81.69 per cent). “This survey provides support for airlines in selecting their in-flight services, and it reinforces our investment in putting travel information at our customers’ fingertips. “When the use of technology is so widespread across our customer base, we know we need to continually innovate to provide the information and the solutions clients are looking for, wherever they are, and whatever they are doing.” About Corporate Travel Management –click here"

During Ms Ruffles’ tenure as a senior executive CTM has reached a number of milestones; its first international acquisition, record new client wins, multiple award wins, launching ground-breaking corporate travel technologies and earlier this year, joining the benchmark ASX200 index. “I am privileged to work with the best team of passionate travel industry professionals, who focus every day on ensuring our customers receive the highest standard of personalised service, whilst delivering a good return on investment for their travel programs,” Ms Ruffles said. “The past five years have been exciting for all of us involved in the growth of CTM, both here and overseas. “As a team, we are looking forward to enhancing our value through excellence in service and new technologies, to be continuously delivered through the months and years ahead.” Ms Ruffles will assume the board position of Claire Gray, Executive Director of Global Development, who is retiring from the board. Mr Bellas thanked Ms Gray for her considerable contribution to CTM’s success over the past seven years. “I have appreciated Claire’s insight and, on behalf of the board and company, thank her for her contribution.” Mr Bellas said Ms Ruffles’ appointment would ensure the board continued to benefit from the insight of experienced travel industry executives.

https://au.travelctm.com/news/ctm-launches-new-app-for-corporate-travellers-in-first-by-australian-company/,"21 July 2016 CTM launches new app for corporate travellers in first by Australian company Corporate travellers can now book every aspect of business travel from their mobile device, following the launch of a new, locally-developed app, the first delivered by an Australian company to target the business travel market. Corporate Travel Management’sCTM Mobileapp allows business travellers to book their flights, car hire and accommodation on their phone through their company’s corporate account, giving travellers increased flexibility and accessibility while ensuring their travel is managed, and approved, according to their company’s travel policy. CTM’s Chief Technology Officer Tom Clark said the new app delivered on company research that found 80 per cent of clients travelled with two or more mobile devices, and 45 per cent had needed to access out of office emergency booking assistance in the past 12 months. “Corporate travel is highly complex, needing to deliver value for clients while ensuring appropriate approvals and oversight are in place – but we do not believe that should be a barrier to giving our clients tools that are intuitive, fast, secure and mobile enabled,” Mr Clark said. “Our clients live in a fast paced, tech-enabled world and they are, by nature, always on-the-go. This means they need to have 24 hour access to travel booking tools when they are outside of the office, and outside of ‘business hours’”. CTM’s research found more than two-thirds of corporate clients in the past 12 months had needed to make a last minute change to their travel plans for business reasons, 28 per cent for personal reasons, and more than 13 per cent due to a natural disaster or other emergency. “When urgent travel assistance is required, its vital that a travel management company provides its clients with mobile technology which provides speed, accessibility and ultimately peace of mind in an otherwise challenging situation,” Mr Clark said. “This is the first Australian-developed, end-to-end mobile app that will allow CTM customers to book their travel across any combination of air, hotel and car hire, via their mobile device as part of their corporate travel program.” Mr Clark said the CTM Mobile app brings the functionality and booking experience clients have come to expect from the leisure market to the corporate sector for the first time, whilst ensuring businesses could maintain risk management and cost control over their corporate travel program. “Our clients benefit from our growing scale and, with that, our growing investment in technology as well. We are doing some amazing things in technology here at CTM and the opportunities to innovate in corporate travel are significant. This will be the first of many iterations to come,” Mr Clark said. “New clients have already told us our technology offering is a valuable point of difference in the market, and we believe our new mobile capability will put us even further ahead.” The application was developed in Australia by CTM’s world-class technology team, but would ultimately be used for CTM’s clients worldwide. The CTM Mobile app is available in the Apple App Store, and will be available in the Google Play store for Android devices over the coming weeks. About Corporate Travel Management –click here"
https://au.travelctm.com/news/post-covid-travel-demand-accelerating-transformation-of-online-travel-retailing/,"4 March 2021 Post-COVID travel demand accelerating transformation of online travel retailing  Post-COVIDtravel demand as pandemic restrictions ease is accelerating the transformation of online travel retailing, giving extra impetus toNew Distribution Capability(NDC) technology which enables highly personalised retail offers based on a traveller’s individual travel history and preferences. Pre-pandemic, the aviation industry made a commitment to transform the way flights are sold online by introducing NDC, with airlines globally investing significantly in progressing this program. The logjam has been that not all agencies and booking channels have invested in developing the technology capability to access NDC content from airlines, meaning that – for the time being – consumers’ access to these deals is limited to a few booking channels that can aggregate content from NDC sources. Qantas is leading the NDC-charge in Australia, and is taking advantage of a resurgence in travel demand following 12 months of reduced leisure and business travel activity. Leveraging its significant investment in developing its own NDC solution, called the Qantas Distribution Platform (QDP), Qantas has recently launched discounted offers to its frequent flyers, with savings of up to 30% on business class airfares booked via QDP-enabled channels. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) has worked with Qantas and other international airlines for more than three years to develop proprietary technology which can consume and sell NDC content, and was the first travel management company in Australia to deliver live NDC content to its corporate customers. CTM Australia & New Zealand CEO, Greg McCarthy said, “NDC is transforming online travel retailing, and delivering significant savings to consumers in the process, which is more important than ever as businesses, and individuals, look forward to getting back to travel. “We’re seeing achievable savings of up to $750 per flight on some of the longer domestic Australian routes, compared against standard airfares. That is a significant saving for businesses, especially those small to medium sized enterprises hard-hit during the pandemic, and it’s encouraging them to travel again to re-connect with their customers, staff and suppliers.” “While its early days, customers are embracing the benefits of the technology. Offers on the Qantas Distribution Platform are encouraging businesses back to travel by delivering meaningful savings to their bottom line.”  -ENDS-  For further information Media enquiries: Alasdair Jeffrey, Rowland –alasdair.jeffrey@rowland.com.au/ +61 404 926 768 About Corporate Travel Management –click here"

The joint venture will see CTM subsidiary Westminster CTM Limited and outbound travel company World 99*, funded by UTour**, establish 99 Westminster e-commerce Company Ltd, which will have distribution rights for CTM’s products outside of China. CTM founder and Managing Director Jamie Pherous said the company had developed an intimate understanding of the unique requirements of Chinese travellers via the 2014 acquisition of Asian travel company Westminster CTM. “The joint venture will enable a travel solution that more suitably caters to the cultural, language and service expectations of the Chinese consumer within China and abroad,” Mr Pherous said. “It allows World 99 to rapidly open up key overseas markets outside of China and create a global market place for Chinese travellers by leveraging CTM’s one contact point across our offices in the Asia Pacific, Europe and the USA. “The alliance also leverages the enormous technical and operational experience, customer base and product diversity that both UTour and World99 possess”, said Mr Pherous. The joint venture requires minimal additional capital, leveraging CTM’s current technology, relationships and processing platform. “We are delighted to be working with such great Chinese travel companies. World 99 has experienced tremendous growth in a short period and is poised to continue its trajectory,” Mr Pherous added. World99 is focused on the FIT market – Chinese free independent travellers – globally, and since founding in April 2014 is now servicing more than 80,000 customers and transacting RMB250m (AUD50.4m) a month. “We have been clear that, above all, acquisitions and partnerships must be the right fit for our business,” Mr Pherous said. “World99 leverages its proprietary technology to integrate the fragmented resources of global suppliers for Chinese consumers.” The companies have been operating under the terms of the joint venture since late in the third quarter of this financial year, and last month alone Westminster CTM issued more than 50,000 tickets for this venture. CTM now expects full year underlying EBITDA to be slightly above the top end of the previous guidance range of $46m-$48m. Mr Pherous said the earnings upgrade reflected the business’ strong ongoing performance across all regions, together with a strategic move into the world’s most populous country.  * World99 (Beijing) Electronic Commerce Co.

CTM was recognised last night at an awards ceremony forBRW’s Most Innovative Companies, with the judges recognising the company’s in-house software development and highlighting CTM’s industry-leading SMART Taxi app. The app matches employees from the same company arriving at an airport within 15 minutes of each other, providing their colleague’s contact information to facilitate a cab-share. The savings can be significant; CTM’s data shows taxis can account for up to 20 per cent of business travel expenditure but less than 5 per cent of taxi share opportunities within businesses are acted on. Since its launch the app has sent more than 17,540 text messages, saving clients tens of thousands of dollars. CTM Chief Marketing and Technology Officer Tom Clark said it was gratifying for industry experts to recognise the company’s focus on continuous improvement. “We are proud that our investment in technology and simplifying travel management is paying dividends for our clients,” Mr Clark said. “Recognition and industry awards are important, but it is the recognition from our customers for the impact we are able to have on their business, and their bottom line, that drives us to continue to improve our products and services.” CTM has developed industry leading software applications which enable corporate customers to find the ideal travel dates to maximise savings, and innovative solutions such as an application which connects travellers from the same company in order to share taxis from their destination airport. “Each of our technology developments have been driven by feedback from our customers or our employees,” Mr Clark said. “They identify challenges in the corporate travel environment which some consider a cost of doing business, but we consider an opportunity to simplify a processes or find new savings. “In a recent survey, 98% of our customers rated highly our technology offering and our client feedback loops suggest that technology and innovation are key factors in their decision to work with CTM.

The project, which involved extensive scenario mapping and planning following initial discussions with the FCDO in March, demonstrated Michael’s and CTM’s ability to innovate and deliver a large-scale solution at speed. “Back in March, the potential scale of the project was unknown,” commented CTM Europe CEO Debbie Carling. “What was understood was that, if it were to be a success, it needed to be ground-breaking with new processes and systems put in place in an incredibly short amount of time. “It would also need a committed, expert and agile team working under exceptional leadership from Michael, who successfully united up to 180 people across CTM at any one time. Focused solely on the FCDO’s repatriation project, they were deployed across a shift pattern on a 24-hour rota to mirror that of the FCDO.

It was a massive shock initially, but also hugely appreciated. Whilst the honour is in my name, I have accepted it in recognition of all of my colleagues across CTM, FCDO, Crown Commercial Service and our Airline Partners who worked in true partnership to successfully deliver a very challenging programme. Given the nature of the C-19 global pandemic, the project operated at fast pace and my award would not have been possible without the energy and passion of the wider team who demonstrated such tremendous commitment in contributing to the effective Government response to a national crisis.” The Rt Hon Dominic Raab, Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, said in a letter to Jamie Pherous, CTM’s Managing Director: “I would like to extend my personal gratitude to you and all your staff who have supported our Charter Repatriation Programme in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The scale of this repatriation effort was unprecedented for all parties. CTM’s ability to find solutions against tight deadlines, and to work in close partnership with the FCDO, were critical to our ability to operate a series of complex flights. I am grateful for the speed and flexibility with which CTM responded, and for your creativity and commitment throughout. Thanks to your efforts, we have successfully bought over 38,000 British nationals back home to the UK. Thank you for being our partner in this historic event.” A Senior FCDO official, said in a letter to Debbie Carling: “The CTM team excelled and I am pleased to recognise this achievement.

The European expansion to CTM’s global network has delivered two globally significant clients in the past six months. Mr Pherous said the global network was opening up new client opportunities while delivering the supplier and efficiency benefits of scale. “We now have more than 100 clients with a presence in multiple countries who, along with other potential clients, are clearly telling us our ability to provide local expertise in all markets is incredibly important to them. “We are seeing the benefits of integrating outstanding businesses and people into the CTM group, providing a robust platform for servicing our clients and continued growth. “The key to our success is surpassing our clients’ expectations, so our focus will be on continual client-facing innovation and leveraging our scale and geography to deliver our clients a constant return on their investment. “Internally we will continue to make it easier and more efficient for our award-winning team to work, which ensures they maximise the time invested in servicing clients. “The structural changes we are making, to align all of our regions, are to ensure our staff are empowered, have client ownership and are able to make quick decisions. “We will continue to grow organically and make acquisitions where they are an appropriate strategic and cultural fit for CTM, and we have demonstrated we are able to successfully integrate such acquisitions while growing market share organically.” The CTM Board has declared a final fully franked dividend of 10.0 cents per share to be paid on October 9, 2015.

See the future and secure savings thanks to Fare Forecaster Getting the best price for flights is important for any Travel Manager who’s keeping a close eye on their travel budget. Fares can vary significantly based on the day of the week due to dynamic airline pricing, something savvy business travelers and companies can take advantage of. But rather than spend hours tracking multiple searches across different dates, we built an app that does just this and included it right inside CTM Portal. We call itFare Forecaster. Just choose your destination and ideal travel date and we’ll display an intuitive analysis of prices for a period of 21 days. Once you’ve chosen the best day to fly that works with your plans and keeps prices low, you can go ahead and book straight away thanks to our deep linked integration with Lightning.

Fare Forecaster makes it fast and simple for your people to do just that.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/business-travel-technology-predictions-for-2023/,"Pathfinders: Business travel technology predictions for 2023  Technology continues to change how the world works and conducts business. Travel is no exception and different fields like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), personalisation, automation, and sustainability are colliding in new and exciting ways that present challenges but also opportunities for travel buyers. To help navigate the changes in business travel technology, we asked CTM’s very own Pathfinders – our technology and product leaders, to guide us through what changes they predict for business travel technology, and what technology they’re building in 2023. Online bookings gets back to basics The pandemic shifted booking business travel from online tools to Travel Consultants as a result of uncertainty around risks, border restrictions, and travel requirements. Now, our team is seeing a push for a return to higher online adoption levels but with a difference.  CTM’s Björn Böhme, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), AU/NZ, is preparing for broader online adoption within organisations explaining “tools need to beeasy and intuitiveto allow users to search and book online and stay online when changes or cancellations arise. I think there will be an expectation that more travellers book themselves as we move on from COVID and as such online booking tools will need to be more user-friendly for infrequent bookers as opposed to Travel Arrangers.” North America’s CTO, Joel Baileyagrees that the shift back to online is a global trend; “It’s happening in North America today as airlines and hoteliers get closer to normal operations and capacity levels, the rules get simpler and self-service has become the expectation again for many trips and traveller groups. It’s the perfect time to revisit your online booking tool (OBT) and ask if it’s fit for the future.” Sustainability is here to stay John Nicholls, CTM’s Global Head of ESGis naturally excited about thenew reality of sustainabilityhaving a greater focus within many travel programs; “Sustainability expectations from clients have risen to increase pressure on the corporate travel market to deliver initiatives that address and meet their sustainability objectives and targets. Clients expect us to identify and implement solutions that provide them with sustainability benefits through technology and supply partnerships. “Technology will play a part in providing travellers with an adequate level of information to highlight which travel choice demonstrates sustainable performance rather than just average emissions. High sustainability performers will be listed as the preferred supplier which is predominantly driven by price, but sustainability performance weighting is added to highlight those top performers when it’s time to book.”  Brian Sheerin, CTM’s CTO EMEA, is also adamant the need for more sustainable travel choices to be embedded into booking technology is only going to grow; “We pioneered carbon budgets in our Lightning online booking tool and we’re excited to see that grow across CTM and the wider industry. If you want to influence behaviour you have to do it at the point of sale.”  AI & ML makes its mark AI and ML are part of the mainstream consumer discussion today thanks to Netflix’s TV recommendations and tools like ChatGPT letting anyone try generative AI for writing, translation or coding. So what about business travel? CTM’s Global CTO, Mike Kubasiksees potential gains in two key areas for Travel Managers and the companies they work with. “ The first will be automating simple travel tasks with AI and ML to not only help make those Travel Consultants more productive, but so they can spend more time providing a truly personal service that’s closer to the VIP experience. “Secondly with the resurgence of NDC underway, airlines are looking for bundle revenue and continuous pricing. You’re talking ten different fares becoming hundreds of different permutations with fluid pricing, something which is tough to manage as a human but AI & ML is perfect for, which is why we’ve beeninvesting in it and fine-tuning our modelsto scale it for mass adoption as these content types come to market.” Quantifying a return on travel Cost control pressures are biting in different regions and industries, but the world has embraced travel once again. How can executives and Travel Program Managers demonstrate travel’s value? Zamil Murji, CTM’s CTO Asia, sees a world of possibilities. “There will be a need for companies to justify travelling from a cost and sustainability perspective – today that means a focus on pre-trip approval and reporting. But more sophisticated data flows where our solutions form part of an end-to-end workflow starting withbudgeting and forecasting toolslinked to approval, data analytics and fed into expense or CRM tools like Salesforce or Dynamics could help businesses make better-informed decisions around travel budgets.” John Nichollsalso sees smarter travel budgeting bringing internal teams together. “Clients will track their essential business travel through both carbon and monetary budgets, transferring to carbon footprints to fully appreciate and understand the impact of business travel in their wider organisation, giving Travel Program Managers a bigger seat at the table internally on matters of operations and sustainability.” Points of consideration when reviewing your travel technology stack Eager to find out more about CTM’s business travel technology suite?

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-drives-travel-personalisation-and-speed/,"Pathfinders: Artificial Intelligence drives business travel personalisation and speed Artificial intelligence (AI) may sound futuristic, but if you’ve shopped onAmazon.com, selected a Netflix series, or asked Siri to complete a task, you’ve already seen and interacted with AI. Organisations are increasingly incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning into their products and services to deliver a greater user experience (UX) for their customers, and CTM is no exception; integrating artificial intelligence solutions to drive business travel efficiencies. In this edition of Pathfinders, we sit down with CTM’s global technology experts, Eric Ediger, Björn Böhme, and Mike Kubasik to dive into what exactly AI is; what benefits it delivers; and how CTM is harnessing its power for our own technology stack. What is artificial Intelligence and machine learning? Eric Ediger: “AI is any type of machine with intelligence that can solve a specific problem. Within the travel industry, an example would be a chatbot. Chatbots can have varying degrees of AI, with the simplest having sets of “if/then” logical statements to guide the decision-making process in the conversation. These solve the problem asked with predetermined sets of answers from its guide, but it doesn’t typically learn or change insights from new input. “Unlike AI, Machine Learning (ML) is when the algorithm can derive new insights based on comparing new data to historical data. As an example, ML may be used in tools that predict airfare pricing fluctuations. This type of tool uses AI to analyse historical flight pricing patterns and compares them to the present to predict future pricing. Learning pricing patterns, especially through high, low and shoulder seasons, these tools can help travellers decide when to book airfares by alerting them to upcoming price increases.”  What are the benefits of artificial intelligence and machine learning for business travel? Eric Ediger: “AI is increasingly used in consumer-facing technology to provide several benefits to users. The first and most widely known benefit is personalisation. By better understanding user behaviour based on travel products or services purchased, we can display relevant options to reduce decision-making, whilst increasing brand trust and loyalty. Ultimately AI supports us in understanding what our customers want, increasing engagement and customer satisfaction. “Intelligent assistants and chatbots can boost customer satisfaction by enabling faster, more convenient service. This intuitive technology can give customers fast answers and solve simple problems, freeing up employees to handle more complex challenges. “AI/ML is already used by CTM to deliver efficient and intuitive service to customers. An example is our fare prediction tool –CTM Fare Forecasterwhich uses AI to learn from historical and current pricing trends to analyse and forecast price fluctuations and drive savings for the customer. Additionally, New Distribution Capability (NDC) provides customers with dynamically curated offers and pricing to make travel services more relevant to the traveller’s needs and preferences without sacrificing performance.”  How do you prioritise where to focus innovation? Björn Böhme: “The beauty of having large data sets and a broad portfolio of products at CTM means our AI/ML adoption isn’t linear. We can learn about travel policy effectiveness, fare prices and personalisation at the same time, while also working on the user experience of recommended results we show in ouronline booking tool –  Lightning. “AI’s logic doesn’t categorise concepts the way we do, so we’re putting it to work in several test environments to improve the customer experience across a whole travel program rather than just one product or communication channel.” Eric Ediger: “Further to Böhme’s comments, we know from our user feedback and global customer surveys that price sensitivity, policy adoption and the user experience are all critical for travel managers which drive our technology roadmap.” How is CTM using AI/ML differently than other travel management companies? Eric Ediger: “CTM is building AI/ML into the fabric of our technology portfolio. The AI layer sits at the substrate level providing insights for applications such as Lightning (recommendations), Portal (travel readiness and risk), CTM Profiles (profile readiness), and is built with scalability in mind using microservices and open architecture for us to scale this globally with a ‘plug-n-play’ approach. We’re integrating with third-party systems and building our own, which allows us to be more agile with product suites globally.” Björn Böhme: “I am excited about the opportunities CTM is creating at the customer experience level distinct from the self-serve online booking tool route. As a global travel management company, we process high volumes of enquiries and bookings, so we have big data that we can segment and analyse with AI to find patterns in how people are booking and managing travel. By automating some of those processes, we can give our customers fast and easy access to the things they want without them needing to wait for an agent.”  How does developing new capabilities with AI/ML differ from other technology development at CTM? Mike Kubasik: “AI/ML is a new approach to solving problems, but only where it makes sense. AI/ML can’t provide the same level of service that real, live employees are capable of, but it can enhance customer service and remove blockers in some areas that will improve overall satisfaction. It’s not the whole solution, but an interesting and complex part of creating a better experience for our customers.” Eric Ediger: “AI/ML requires some specialised knowledge, so we’ve made investments in a team of data scientists and database administrators, as well as opportunities for our current developers to grow their knowledge of AI/ML.” What long-term opportunities for AI/ML is CTM interested in? Mike Kubasik: “I am excited for the direction in which CTM is heading. We are focused on developing our AI/ML systems for scalability and global integration. We’ve already implemented some AI/ML features in our online booking tool and CTM Portal and looking forward to rolling out more enhancements that will support our customers in areas of savings, speed, safety, and sustainability. “We are also integrating AI/ML capabilities into many of CTM’s business operations to drive operational efficiencies across our business. We are harnessing our data to drive more strategic and effective planning and decision-making which, in turn, ensures the most effective, timely and relevant outcomes for our customers, employees and partners.” Find out how artificial intelligence drives business travel innovation at CTM and how it can benefit your business.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/lower-business-travel-carbon-emissions-with-lightning/,"Lower business travel carbon emissions with Lightning Travel is back and a new mindset around sustainability has flourished. Businesses around the world are committing to ambitious net-zero targets, governments are supporting with green taxes alongside rebates, loans and grants for greener investments in agriculture, renewables and energy-efficient cities. Sustainable travel choices and more detailed information on the environmental impact of supply chains have continued to rise in the customer priorities in CTM’s Global Customer Survey for 2022. Travellers, Travel Bookers, andTravel Managerswant an online booking platform that provides accurate guidance on emissions for flights, hotels and train travel so they can make informed decisions and influence a more sustainable restart to travel for their employees and productions. Travel Managers and sustainability leads within organisations also want to be able to set and monitor achievable reductions in their carbon emissions from travel. To support these needs of our customers around the world, CTM has developed a whole range of tools and functionality in our online booking platform, Lightning, to help businesses drive greener travel initiatives. It’s greener on this side: CO2 per airfare segment in Lightning search results For many years, CTM has provided dedicated carbon emissions reporting and offsetting through our dedicated Climate+ dashboard and suite of reports where you can see a breakdown of emissions by travel type, cabin class, region, cost centre and more, as well as real carbon market data on offset costs per tonne, per trip and traveller. Analytics and reporting are great for understanding the level of impact or what key drivers are, but influencing new behaviours is a different challenge, one that requires different tools to engage employees in new ways. That’s why we’re adding CO2calculations at the individual airfare, hotel night and car hire segments in Lightning search results.     Did you know that the emissions for a flight from Sydney to Singapore can vary as much as 19% from one business seat on one flight to another that same day? Or that the variance between the biggest emissions and lowest between flights in economy on the same route are as much as 28%? With such a significant variance in emissions from one airline to another, travellers must be informed at the point of search and booking, which is why we’ve made it easily visible alongside the price of each fare segment for all classes. Stat check: Understand passenger emissions by aircraft and cabin  Calculating business travel carbon emissions: The proof is in the data For accurate flight CO2 calculations, CTM knew we had to turn to aviation specialists who understood how airlines operated, how elements like seat configuration mattered but also where to source, analyse and model that data to help deliver accurate and useful CO2 calculations that were also readily available to be consumed in an API format for our products and services. This has been accomplished in partnership withRDC Aviation, a dedicated data aggregation provider to airlines and the aviation industry that strives to make aviation data accessible. RDC works directly with many of the world’s best-known airlines and also more recently, airports and other partners in the travel supply chain. Thanks to their granular data aggregation and analysis, we can show the different CO2 emissions impact for economy vs premium and business cabins onboard the same flight, quickly helping travellers to understand the proportional share of emissions larger seats take up on each flight. For flights, emissions are calculated using official data from RDC’smulti-dimensional methodologythat provides more accuracy in comparison to other respected sources. RDC takes route and aircraft type plus more granular factors such as engine type, age, fuel burn, and much more to give you a detailed picture. They maintain a comprehensive database of airlines, aircraft and engine types, and seating configurations of more than 35,000 airframes which enables a more granular calculation to be made. RDCs database also includes: CTM continues to work very closely with RDC to ensure all our routes are covered and we deliver carbon emission estimates that are as accurate as scientifically possible.  Why is the RDC methodology better? International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) calculate fuel burn for the specific aircraft type operating a flight segment and converts the resultant fuel burn to CO2 using the standard conversion factor. RDC calculate fuel burn in a similar way to ICAO but the significant difference is in the allocation of emissions. RDC maintains a comprehensive database of airlines, aircraft and engine types and seating configurations of more than 35,000 airframes which enables a more granular calculation to be made. The application of airline-specific seat configurations allows emissions to be attributed on a per seat, per passenger or per cabin/seat basis, more accurately highlighting the difference in emissions per passenger and enabling more informed customer decisions about the impact of their travel. Stat check: Understand passenger carbon emissions by region Kickstarting sustainability We’re excited to add carbon emissions for individual travel types and segments into Lightning search results. The CTM team is committed to creating a more sustainable future for travel through a combination of innovation, strategic guidance for our customers, and investment in sustainable aviation fuels like ourpartnership with Delta Airlines. If you’d like to see what the power of Lightning can bring to your travel program, book a demo today.  Radiative ForcingThe IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has identified that aircraft emissions at altitude have a greater impact on the atmosphere due to other non-CO2 climate change effects from aviation (e.g., NOx, water vapour, contrails). To compensate for this increased effect, it’s recommended to apply a multiplier to aircraft carbon emissions to ensure a realistic representation of the impacts. This multiplier is called Radiative Forcing Index, or RFI. CTM follows the most reputable sources and applies their estimates. As such, CTM has taken the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) recommended RFI of 1.9. Looking to reduce your business travel carbon emissions?

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/agile-technology/,"How an agile technology mindset transforms business travel Technology resides at the heart of the corporate travel experience. When applied successfully, it delivers value and productivity to organisations, while also enhancing the individual traveller’s experience. Today, every aspect of a journey can be managed with the touch of a button for maximum productivity, reliability, comfort and enjoyment. In this rapidly-evolving technological landscape, how can travel management companies ensure customers always have quick and easy access to the most innovative and meaningful travel tools? At Corporate Travel Management (CTM), we understand the importance of flexible and transparent development processes that respond directly to customer needs. That is why our technology teams across the world have adopted the “agile” approach to building and upgrading our own proprietary travel technology.  What is agile? Agile incorporates multiple methodologies based on iterative and incremental development. The best solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams. This process has been chiefly used in software development to improve speed to market and productivity.Traditionally, development processes have been more linear and rigid, which heightens the risk of creating unsuitable tools that are out of date at the time of delivery. Customer benefits The agile process allows customers to see tangible results at regular intervals throughout product development and share related feedback to drive further enhancements. Critically for the fast-paced travel industry, the agile approach speeds up development processes and provides the capacity to pivot and change plans within an ever-changing landscape, while also keeping to tight deadlines. The speed of change Change is one of the few constants in the travel industry and this demands a timely response from travel management companies. CTM is committed to a rapid deployment cycle for technology releases that keeps pace with continuously evolving market conditions. Our teams execute the development lifecycle in smaller increments, known as “sprints”. This allows for iterative product enhancement that can be delivered within days and weeks, contrasting with the more cumbersome approach of projects being planned up front and executed against that plan. Continuous integration, continuous delivery When starting a new project, our teams look for ways to automate the build, test and deployment pipeline. CTM’s development pipeline progresses from understanding customer requirements, designing then developing a solution, running tests, through to deployment. This is followed by a feedback and review process where further enhancements can be incorporated. Customer comes first CTM puts the user front and centre of technology development. We communicate directly with customers at every stage of the process, helping us to move quickly from idea-generation to deployment. Through our CTM User Labs, customers have early access to products and this, coupled with our iteration model, allows us to source direct end-user insights and data. This connects the people who build our products with the people who use them. This collaborative approach provides a better understanding of customers’ specific requirements, while our continuous feedback loops empower them to share ideas on how to improve our product offering. We integrate this information with the latest market and industry intelligence. As a result, CTM delivers technology which is flexible and engineered to last, and our tools are the most intuitive, responsive and easy to use on the market. Global network, local solutions CTM’s global technology strategy is delivered by regional development teams which work out of technology hubs in all four of the market regions we operate. Within these hubs, our cross-functional teams work closely together on projects with an immediacy that delivers results. While our global network is underpinned by compatible systems and processes in every market, our local tech teams understand exactly what is happening on the ground in their regions. They liaise directly with customers to ensure localised, tailored solutions that are both meaningful and relevant to businesses of all sizes. Technology that delivers CTM recognises the role agility can play in meeting and exceeding customer expectations. Our technology development roadmaps are built around tomorrow’s travel landscape, ensuring we are always one step ahead. Whether keeping travellers informed while on the road or allowing travel arrangers to make the best decisions for their businesses, CTM has the powerful and reliable tools to meet our customers’ unique and ever-changing travel needs.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/creating-sustainable-business-events/,"Creating sustainable business events  Business meetings, conferences and events are a large part of business, providing employees, customers, partners and the supply chain opportunities to build meaningful relationships, share knowledge, innovate and grow.According to a 2022 CTM global customer survey conducted in May, 59 % of respondents are seeking to conduct more in-person meetings over the next 12 months. CTM’s specialist event management divisionETMis positioned to assist customers in delivering more sustainable event and travel choices that support people, communities and the environment. Sustainability solutions such as theCTM Climate+ programassist customers to better understand the impact of their travel and also provide solutions to reach climate neutrality goals.  Sustainability has increasingly become a global focus. More than400 companies signed a pledgeat 2021’s Davos World Economic Forum to decarbonise by 2050. This number comprises some of the biggest companies in the world, and smaller companies are making similar commitments. Organisations are reviewing their policies and processes to encourage more sustainable choices and practices. Whilst the thought of arranging an event that meets organisational sustainability strategies and policy might be overwhelming, small and manageable actions can go a long way to protecting the environment, supporting local communities, and also may save organisations some money along the way. Good planning and event design Using an event management company will ensure expert advice, strategic planning and event design to meet the requirements of the organisation. However, in the discovery phase of the planning, organisations must be clear on their sustainability goals and what they wish to achieve. A more sustainable event design may require consideration of where and how an organisation wishes to host their events. Should a central venue location be selected? A consideration might be to host outdoor breakout sessions to reduce electricity use for example. Selecting suppliers that fit with an organisation’s sustainability policy will be of importance. Where organisations have had established relationships with suppliers, but no longer align, a consideration of sourcing new suppliers may be made. Going digital (pending the demographic of your audience) may be part of an organisation’s preferred delivery method. Utilising online registration and communication platforms is more sustainable, cost-effective, and will save delegates time and eliminate paper printouts. Creating sustainable business events involves planning and preparation. An event management company like ETM can assist in carefully examining all areas of an event to determine how it can become more sustainable and environmentally friendly, including location, transportation and food. Selecting event partners An event’s carbon footprint can be reduced by looking at some of the big decisions in the event planning process, like where the event is held. According to a recentGlobal Business Travel Association sustainability report,74% of respondents rank both investing in more energy-efficient technologies and phasing out single-use plastic products as the most impactful way for their suppliers to improve their environmental performance. Further to this, the 2022 CTM global customer survey revealed72% of respondents say having access to supply chain sustainability strategy information in the coming 12 months is important – very important and 57% seek environmental sustainability features when selecting airline, hotel, and car rental providers. As such, organisations may wish to make event sustainability a requirement when selecting a venue, sponsors or associated event partners as part of the event’s overall sustainability goals. The ultimate goal for organisations may be to have all stakeholders aligned in their sustainability efforts. This will help create a more seamless experience where organisations are not the only ones contributing toward a sustainable event.  When procuring event partners, questions to consider might be: Find ways to reduce food waste Having sufficient catering is always of importance, ensuring delegates are energised to learn, network and be engaged through the duration of the event. However, there are considerations to make that will assist in reducing food wastage.  Partnering with a venue that has already established sustainable practices will make catering easier. This way, they may already have recycling or composting programs in place. In cases where the venue does not have such programs established, there may be an opportunity to donate to a local food donation program (in accordance with food and health regulations). Check with the venue as they may already work with local charities including food banks or social enterprises. Another consideration around food is to order local food. Whilst it will not reduce waste, it is a better option not only in terms of environmental responsibility but also in supporting the local economy and offering a local experience for your delegates, especially for international visitors. Reuse and recycle Recycling is not new and is a big part of sustainable living and something that can be easily implemented into an organisation’s sustainable event strategy. For things like lanyards and signs, organisations may wish to avoid personalising them where possible so they can be reused for future events. That way, this reduces waste but also saves money and time. Banning single-use plastic can be applied to menu choices with minimal packaging, ideally supplied in biodegradable or recyclable containers. With many more sustainable products available, whether it be biodegradable or bamboo for example, there are sufficient options to reduce your event’s carbon footprint. Recycling education for delegates can also be carried out by inserting notices in event programmes or listed digitally. Placing clear signs on bins and communicating where and why to recycle will make it easier for delegates to know what to do and where to go. Having dedicated stations to collect recyclable materials will mean after the event recycling will be easy and prevent wastage. Other areas of consideration might be: Conference tote bags have historically been filled with plastic promotional items and use energy and resources to produce, only to be discarded in rubbish and end up in landfill. Organisations need to think about what they want to achieve by providing tote bags. For those that do decide to provide them to delegates, consider providing reusable branded tote bags, recycled notebooks, plant and seed packets, reusable cups and mugs. This also provides opportunities for extended brand awareness through repeated use. Organisations may also like to refrain from date stamping any of the items for longevity and future use. To ensure the promotional suppliers are using ethically sourced materials that are environmentally friendly, a recommendation is to ask what social and environmental certifications the suppliers have. Reduce carbon footprint The global pandemic has cast a spotlight on sustainability where83% of global travellersbelieve sustainable travel is vital and 61% say the pandemic has made them want to travel more sustainably in the future. There are more sustainable options for organisations to consider when it comes to transport, whether it be land or air, and this may result in reducing the carbon footprint.  In the CTM 2022 global customer survey,71% of respondents said their carbon footprint will be an important to very important consideration for their travel program over the next 12 months. Through CTM Climate+ organisations can calculate, record and report CO2 emissions per trip and per traveller by:  Did you know?

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/ctm-introduces-nabers-hotel-ratings/,"CTM introduces NABERS Hotel Ratings  Corporate Travel Management (CTM) has partnered withNABERS(National Australian Built Environment Rating System) as the first and only* travel management company to display the NABERS Hotel Ratings for accredited hotels in an online booking tool (OBT). This initiative allows users of CTM’s Lightning OBT to quickly and easily view which accommodation providers have been assessed for their environmental sustainability, and ultimately make more sustainable hotel choices that align with their climate neutrality objectives. What is NABERS Hotel Ratings NABERS, a national initiative managed by NSW Government DPIE, is a rating system that measures the environmental performance of Australian buildings, hotels, tenancies and homes.  NABERS assesses the energy efficiency, water usage, waste management and indoor environment quality of a building or tenancy and its impact on the environment, and provides a ‘star’ rating according to the efficiency of the property compared with industry benchmarks (1 – lowest to 6 – highest). There are currently approximately 1,760 buildings* in Australia that have NABERS ratings. NABERS and Lightning CTM worked in collaboration with the City of Sydney and NABERS to develop a visual indication of a properties’ NABERS star rating within the Lightning OBT booking process. If a property has been accredited by NABERS, their energy or water efficiency rating will clearly display on the hotel’s search result in Lightning. See screenshots below.   CTM customers using Lightning already have access to see NABERS rated properties. If you’re not currently a CTM customer, or do not have access to our Lightning OBT,contact our teamfor a demo. Why NABERS Hotel Ratings matter Environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly important to individuals and businesses that want to measure their carbon footprint and meet their climate neutrality goals. NABERS ratings help businesses to choose office buildings and accommodation providers that can assist in reaching these goals. CTM’s climate initiatives CTM is dedicated to reducing its own carbon footprint, as well as that of our customers.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/new-travel-technology-experiences-driving-safety-hygiene-and-efficiency/,"New travel technology experiences driving safety, hygiene and efficiency  As countries across the world emerge from lockdown, international travel is gradually resuming in stages. Safety will be the top priority for travellers as they return to travel.  The travel industry is well advanced in developing innovative new technologies to drive safety, hygiene and efficiency across every aspect of the travel experience. In this blog, we explore six emerging technologies currently being deployed across the travel industry to identify new, viable solutions and experiences which may define the new normal in travel. Contactless travel Contactless travel will be the most obvious change in experience from airport to hotel sectors. Bio-metrics are already a widely accepted solution for identity verification and more touchless options are being piloted, such as gesture control, touchless document scanning and voice commands. Contactless check-In:Hilton will double-down on its award-winningDigital Keytechnology for guests who desire to have a contactless arrival experience. Guests can determine the amount of contact they prefer when they check-in, as well as select their room and access their room via a digital key from their mobile device through the Hilton Honors mobile app. Contactless elevator:Abu Dhabi Airport has deployed newtouchless technology across 53 elevatorsat the airport to reduce physical touchpoints. Contactless kiosks and immigration lanes:Singapore Changi Airport has introduced contactless kiosks for travellers to check-in and drop-off their baggage. Travellers can select options and key-in details by pointing their finger close to the screen without touching it. The airport has also upgraded the automated immigration lanes using face and iris recognition new travel technology to replace fingerprint scanning.  Digital Health Passports An increasing number of countries are now exploring ways to provide travellers with digital health passports to allow them to travel abroad. The digital health passport is a web-based platform that certifies an individual’s health status, including COVID-19 and other health considerations, prior to travel. Pilot flight using digital health passport:In July 2020, a flight from the Canary Islands to Madrid will utilise a digital health passport developed by Canadian companyHi+ Card. This world-first initiative, back by the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), will see passengers utilise the Hi+ Card smartphone app – which is secured by blockchain protocols – to certify that they are not infected with COVID-19. Blockchain protocols will “avoid the possibility of false profiles being created or medical records being manipulated,” said Antonio López de Ávila, CEO of Madrid-based Tourism Data Driven Solutions (TDDS). Digital Identity Digital identity, including personal identity and health information, is fast-becoming the new norm in travel. Travellers will be able to securely store their identity and health credentials within a digital wallet for requiredrisk assessmentsprior to travel and for airport experiences, such as digital check-in via their mobile devices, to minimise queuing and physical contact at the airport. Digital ID for a seamless journey:With IATA’s concept ofOne ID, travellers will be able to further streamline their journey with a document-free process based on identity management and bio-metric recognition. “We are looking to global standards to help passengers navigate the airport without having to prove their identity over and over. IATA’s One ID project proposes face, iris or fingerprint recognition to seamlessly move passengers from curb to gate. The technology exists today. And we will be urging governments – vital partners to make One ID work – to move quickly.” Alexandre de Juniac, Director General and CEO, IATA. Travellers will be able to identify themselves at each airport touchpoint through a simple bio-metric recognition to eliminate repetitive processes, resulting in less queuing and a more seamless journey.  Automated Retail and Mobile Ordering Automated retail and mobile ordering is a new concept being explored by retailers, enabling travellers to make purchases using their mobile device to increase efficiencies and reduce non-essential physical interactions and cash payments. Cashier-less store:BC Card has opened an unmanned convenience store in Seoul featuring itscashier-less technology. After scanning a QR code to enter the store, customers can pick up products of their choice then simply walk past an automated gate to finish shopping. Payment for goods will be handled automatically via the mobile payment app Paybooc when the customer walks out of the store.  Airport food pre-ordering:Hong Kong International Airport provides a food pre-ordering service for travellers via its mobile app ‘HKG My Flight’ ormobile website. Travellers can place an order, select the time to pick-up, and make payment using their mobile device, then collect their food from the restaurant. Pay cashless at the airport:Munich Airport is offering travellers with acashless payment processwhich lets them use their mobile device to pay for goods at the shelf by scanning an electronic price tag to eliminate waiting times at the cash register. For payment, the customer is redirected to a mobile website and won’t be required to download the app.  Virtual Queuing In support of social distancing, real-person queuing may gradually be replaced by virtual queuing to prevent close congregation in one area. Virtual queuing new travel technology allows airlines to notify travellers via their app when their seat is ready for boarding and enables airports to control queue entry. Virtual queuingfor boarding:Delta has addedvirtual queuingtechnology into its mobile app, helping to reduce gate area queues to make the boarding processes more efficient. Passengers will receive a personal notification when their specific seat zone is getting ready to board.          Image Source: Delta Air Lines Airline Reassurance Data In a recent Corporate Travel Management (CTM) customer survey relating to post-COVID-19 business travel, it was clearly identified that our customers are eager for extra information relating to the health and safety of their chosen travel services. CTM has integratedATPCO’s Reassurance UPAsinto the Lightning online booking tool, providing customers with access to a wide range of health and safety features from more than 100 airlines globally alongside the flight search results.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/atpco-interviews-ctm/,"ATPCO & CTM interview: Informed travel decisions will increase traveller confidence and aid business recovery  This interview was conducted by ATPCO and originally posted on the ATPCO blog. One of the world’s most successful travel management companies, CTM (Corporate Travel Management), is researching the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic onbusiness travel.In their customer survey earlier this month, they learned that health and safety questions are looming on travellers’ minds. That’s why they speedily added ATPCO’s Reassurance UPAs to Lightning, their online booking tool, so that customers who are preparing to travel for business again can book with more confidence. We talked with Scott Ward, CTM Global Head of Partnerships, about the economic significance of corporate travel and what the future might hold. Here’s the interview. ATPCO: How does CTM see the impact of COVID-19 influencing the future of corporate travel? CTM:It goes without saying that COVID-19 will have a significant impact on the way people travel for business and leisure in future. The travel industry, governments and health organisations worldwide are working tirelessly to adapt their services to what will become the “new normal” in travel. In a recent global CTM customer survey, that addressed the future of business travel post-COVID-19, our customers highlighted that COVID-19-imposed travel restrictions had significantly impacted business growth and financial performance as well as their ability to effectively support and engage customers and employees. This tells us that the ability to travel is critical to business success, and that corporate travel will play an important role in economic recovery. This is reassuring for businesses that service the travel sector. From travel agencies, airports, airlines, hotel and car rental suppliers, to the supporting industries such as cleaning, catering, technology, security, entertainment and more, the travel industry has been heavily impacted by COVID-19 but will undoubtedly adapt, evolve and innovate to enable businesses to return to travel with confidence.   ATPCO: How is CTM responding to the impact of COVID-19? CTM:We expect the role of travel management companies (TMCs) will become far more holistic, providing businesses with a broader range of consultancy support beyond traditional travel booking, reporting and supplier management. CTM has listened to our customers concerns about their return to travel and is well underway in delivering new solutions and technologies that provide our customers with the information they need to get back to business travel as quickly and safely as possible. We believe the future TMC will need to provide businesses with seamless, integrated travel insights and intelligence spanning government health and travel advice, quarantine measures, and sophisticated risk management tools including traveller tracking and emergency communications, to enable businesses and their employees to travel more safely, efficiently and cost-effectively than ever before. Business travel is largely regional by nature, and we therefore expect that TMCs, businesses and business travellers will be the early adopters of new travel tools and technologies developed in response to COVID-19. As such, our teams have been working closely with travel suppliers, governments and industry innovators to prioritise the development of new travel solutions which will enable our customers to make more informed travel decisions that will increase traveller confidence and aid business recovery at the earliest opportunity. This recovery is important for our customers’ business, and therefore central to our own business strategy.    ATPCO: Let’s talk about airline retailing. Travellers will likely need answers to different questions next time they are going to buy a ticket. What are you hearing from your clients? CTM:This is true. Our customers have shared their questions and concerns over the future travel environment, and at the top of their agenda is how to ensure the safety and well-being of their travellers. They want to understand everything related to health across every aspect of their travel experience. How is cleaning being implemented at airports and in-flight? How will I know whether there’s a health issue at my destination? Will I be required to quarantine on my return? How will I know if someone on my flight is unwell? How will the airline serve sterile meals and drinks on-board? Do I need to provide my own face mask for travel? It’s going to be increasingly important for businesses to incorporate regulatory health and safety measures into their travel program, and to identify and manage potential risks both before and during the travel experience. This is where access to technology and communication will be key. From pre-trip approval technology that can identify destination-based travel and health risks prior to booking, to information relating to the travel suppliers and their services at the point of sale, and traveller tracking and emergency communications tools during travel. This is a fast-changing environment and solutions are evolving at speed. At CTM, we are committing to ensuring our customers have access to the most robust and reliable solutions at the earliest opportunity, and by controlling our own technology development and deployment we are able to listen to our customers’ concerns and deliver relevant and high-value solutions at speed.    ATPCO: Reassurance UPAs, a type of visual rich content introduced in response to global crisis, are designed to help airlines communicate the important measures they are taking to protect traveller health and safety when they fly. What led CTM to incorporate Reassurance UPAs in your platform at such a quick pace? CTM:CTM has a range of feedback loops in place to collate insights from customers, employees, suppliers and industry partners, which ensures we are always listening to and responding to current and future market needs. Our latest customer research relating to post-COVID-19 business travel clearly identified our customers’ appetite for extra information relating to the health and safety of their chosen travel services. In our survey, nearly 70% of respondents said that information relating to travel supplier service updates would enable their business to travel again with greater confidence. ATPCO’s Reassurance UPAs provide CTM with access to a wide range of health and safety features from more than 100 airlines globally via a single API. Because CTM develops its own proprietary technology from our four regional tech hubs, our teams were able to rapidly develop and deploy the live airline data feed into Lightning’s flight search results in just a couple of weeks, meeting the needs of our customers around the globe.   ATPCO: How exactly is this new content being used and what do you expect the business impact to be? CTM:Having access to reliable, consolidated data direct from the source and built into the booking process presents a significant time-saving advantage for our customers as well as ticking boxes for peace-of-mind, accuracy and reliability. We have configured our Lightning online booking tool to consume and display the Reassurance UPA messages within the flight search results, enabling customers to easily identify relevant health and safety measures provided by the airline as part of their fare results and before making the booking. As more airlines build out their UPA capability, our tools are ready to serve that information to our customers. Airline reassurance features cover a variety of categories such as cabin cleaning, food and beverage hygiene, and passenger and crew wellbeing. In addition to these on-board features, there is also the ability to view features relating to health screening, airport cleaning, and flexible booking conditions if made available by the airline. Within the flight search results, the reassurance features for each service will be displayed in a variety of formats including easily identifiable icons and text descriptions.  ATPCO: Does CTM have any further plans for integrating Routehappy Rich Content in your tools? How do you see rich content complementing or enhancing CTM’s tools? CTM:CTM has been a customer of Routehappy (now ATPCO) for a number of years, and we have integrated multiple content types into our Lightning online booking tools including amenities and product attributes. We are proud to be at the forefront of providing relevant and high-value content to our customers to assist them in their decision-making and enhancing the overall business travel experience. We will continue to seek feedback from our customers, employees and industry partners to ensure we are leveraging all available content that adds value or solves a specific problem for our customers in relation to the safety, efficiency and value of their travel program. In this dynamic travel environment with fast-changing government regulations, health advice and travel supplier offerings, CTM’s ability to quickly identify and integrate new data sources into our customer-facing technology will remain critical to empowering businesses to get back to business travel as quickly and safely as possible so they can meet their future business objectives.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/transforming-business-travel-with-ai-insights/,"Transforming business travel with AI insights Brian Sheerin, Corporate Travel Management’s (CTM’s) Chief Technology Officer EMEA, offers his perspective on the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) in business travel. In this blog, Sheerin explores our common resistance to change, despite AI’s immense potential for positive impact, and highlights the ability of AI to personalise the travel experience. The AI debate It’s hard to believe, but AI has been around since the 1940s. Yet, only now does it feel like we are on the cusp of a revolution in the way it impacts our lives. I think the tipping topic at London Tech Week in June, and Rishi Sunak has confirmed the UK will host the first global summit on AI (the AI Summit on Safety) later this year.  Currently, it feels like the AI debate is dominated by the negatives: safety, legislation, and job losses, all of which are fair game but also spotlight just how much humans resist change. Like all tech, AI can be a force for good. It has enabled everything from e-commerce upselling and personal viewing recommendations on Netflix, to the likely success of autonomous vehicles and facial recognition. And it gets bigger than that when we start talking about AI in healthcare – it’s suggested AI could build machines sophisticated enough to detect diseases, identify cancer cells and create customised prevention as well as treatment. Who wouldn’t want that? Personalised offerings It’s AI’s ability to personalise offerings that makes it so powerful and relevant to the business travel industry. In the short term, I think we’ll see the biggest impact through Chatbots, online booking tools, and offline service desks. At CTM, we’ve already deployed AI across our online booking toolLightningto deliver personalised results that consider historical booking data and traveller preferences that are also – and this is the important bit – compliant with the company’s travel policy. As more bookings are made, the machine will learn, and accuracy will increase in line with traveller trust and adoption.  We’re already seeing major improvements from AI in terms of product matches, speed of responses, and overall customer experience and we are now looking to extend its use across all our products, reducing the need for user intervention and automating as much of the process as possible. If we can proactively deal with travel requests and remove search forms and other administrative tasks without compromising on quality and the human element, that will be a big next step. AI needs data Of course, AI is nothing without data, so it’s key for travel management companies (TMCs) and other business travel suppliers to continually feed it with supplier and customer data, ensuring it learns how to match requirements and deliverables with increasing accuracy. In my opinion, if we use AI sensibly, it will provide quality products and services faster than we have access to today. In fact, speed of response when it comes to delivering results/bookings and handling queries and questions, is one of the top three benefits of using AI in business travel. The other two are; accuracy of requirement/deliverable matching based on previous customer experiences and demands, and cost savings- with service costs being driven down and preferential pricing being reliably offered across multiple sources. Given buyers are still under pressure to cut costs and make budgets work harder, this makes using a TMC with AI-integrated technology a very attractive option.  There is a lot to look forward to So, in my opinion, there are many good things to look forward to when it comes to AI in relation to travel technology, but I would also warn against moving too fast, just because we can. It’s important to not race too far ahead of businesses’ (and their travellers’) understanding and needs.  Our 2023 CTM Global Customer Survey research has shown that just 3.73% of customers indicated they want to useChatGPTfor booking business travel, compared to more than 60% who prefer to book via an online booking tool or through the CTM Portal. That’s not to say their needs won’t evolve, history shows they will, and that’s why we will continue to invest in developing proprietary technology at speed, but always in line with our customers needs and objectives.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/save-on-business-travel-with-fare-forecasting/,"Save on business travel with fare forecasting  Picking the right time to fly has always been a challenge. The volume of flights on busy routes can make it incredibly complex to calculate when to fly, when to return and sometimes even which route to take if there’s no direct option. Airlines know that business travellers often have to book last-minute and take advantage of this by increasing prices as the departure date gets closer, unlike traditional retailers who discount leftover stock to sell the maximum total volume. The global travel restrictions imposed during 2020 drastically impacted business and leisure travel activity, with carriers reducing their schedules and even retiring once-profitable routes to match demand. As airlines now move into ‘travel recovery’ mode, they’re reintroducing services and adjusting pricing and availability once again, causing prices to fluctuate for the foreseeable future. As business travel activity returns, there’s extra scrutiny on travel budgets and heightened pressure on travel managers. It’s never been more important to get the best price on travel and demonstrate the ROI to the company. Thankfully, simple adjustments to travel patterns can reap significant dividends to the company’s bottom line. That’s whereCTM’s Fare Forecastingtechnology can help. Simply enter your travel criteria and you’ll be presented with the cheapest time to travel across the surrounding 21 days, all in a single search.  Are you paying too much for business travel? In a recent global analysis*,Corporate Travel Management(CTM) found thatshifting an overnight itinerary by just 24-48 hours could regularly save business travellers upwards of 20%, and in many cases over 40%, on their flight price.This was consistent across Australia & New Zealand, the US, Europe, and Asia. While not every trip can be moved to a different day, the savings on offer mean that even if just a minority of travellers switch their travel dates by just one or two days the savings will still be impactful. As airlines gradually bring back routes and capacity, it will have a knock-on effect on demand. You can expect jumps in availability to cause fluctuations in pricing that weren’t as common pre-COVID. Match that with companies getting their people back out on the road again thanks to a vaccine and refined safety measures, and you’ve got a recipe for inconsistent pricing by airlines day to day and week to week. Show me the money - where can I save? UsingCTM’s Fare Forecasterfeature, we analysed* the top routes across Australia & New Zealand, the US, Europe and Asia. As an example, we found that it was possible to save between 27-34% on flights from Sydney (SYD) to Melbourne (MEL), and 49-63% on flights from Auckland (AKL) to Christchurch (CHC) for multiple travel dates across the following three months.  When you’re able to achieve savings of over 10% regularly on flights, that has a big impact on an organisation’s annual travel budget, which will be more important in the coming year and beyond than in previous years. How does Fare Forecaster work? CTM’s Fare Forecasterfeature is a proprietary development by CTM and is available in all regional markets we serve.Fare Forecaster displays the cheapest fares available 10-days either side of your selected travel date, including your corporate travel deals, so you know you’re seeing all the options that matter. By maintaining an agile approach to our technology development, we’re able to continually add new content sources to make Fare Forecaster even more helpful in deciding when to travel. Fare Forecaster is built into theCTM Portalalongside a wide range of travel tools so you and your travellers have instant access to quickly and easily search for the best time to travel. Thanks to Fare Forecaster, travellers and travel bookers no longer have to keep multiple search windows open on their company booking tool, saving them both time and frustration when booking for themselves or on behalf of others. Lightning OBT integration At CTM we’ve been able to leverage the benefits of our proprietary technology further bydeep linking from Fare Forecaster intoLightning, our proprietary online booking tool. This integration means you can go from a simple Fare Forecaster flight search to identify the best date to travel, all the way through to booking those cheaper flights in just a few clicks withinLightning, without repeated searches on different tools. This helps save your people time and money while keeping your business travel booking experience simple and secure. Manic Monday or a Ruby Tuesday? Friday, I'm in love. If you’re looking for a simple answer to the question “what day should I fly?”, there isn’t one. When analysing flight pricing across multiple regions and routes, the most consistent part of pricing variations is the inconsistency. While it’s often cheaper to fly at weekends, we ruled out flying on Saturdays and Sundays from our cost comparisons to focus on weekdays, when business travellers are more likely to be flying. 2020 ushered in mass flexible working, which should help combat some of the historic limitations facing business travellers’ availability to travel for work. In the past, last-minute bookings and minimal flexibility were the hallmarks of the road warrior, but now there’s an opportunity to realign booking behaviour among your travellers as they begin planning office visits, client meetings and conference travel to ensure you get the most value for money from your travel program.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/proprietary-tech-in-a-pandemic/,"Proprietary technology in the face of a pandemic  In 2020, the travel sector was one of the industries most significantly disrupted by COVID-19 restrictions. As a global travel management company with in-house global tech teams and proprietary technology solutions,Corporate Travel Management’s(CTM’s) pro-active response to the pandemic was key to its business continuity and its ability to support customers in their return to safe, efficient and cost-effective business travel. CTM’s Global Chief Technology Officer, Michael Kubasik, explained “CTM has a long history of innovating, adapting and investing in proprietary technology. This strategy enabled the business to respond quickly to the pandemic. Having our ownin-house technologyhas enabled us to deploy many first-to-market solutions to our corporate customers and continues to support their new and evolving travel needs in a post-COVID environment.” With business travel looking different today, both on the road and behind the scenes, CTM has used its technology to deliver fast-changing intelligence direct to customers and employees. “Supported by CTM’s24/7 customer serviceand an intuitive, reliable and accessible technology framework, our customers have been empowered to return to travel, where borders permit, with maximum safety, efficiency and confidence. Our solutions also enable businesses to increase visibility and control over their budget expenditure and program compliance while meeting their duty of care obligations” said Kubasik. “This has never been more important than now, as our clients look to squeeze even greater value out of their travel investment.”  A global vision, built and deployed for regional needs The role of travel management providers has shifted dramatically in recent years, from transactional booking fulfilment to a more holistic advisory and consultancy relationship. “Understanding our customers’ corporate travel program objectives as well their travellers’ unique travel trends and preferences is key to driving highly personalised experiences that deliver on safety, wellbeing, compliance and cost control” said Kubasik. In adapting its service and technology offering to a COVID-19 environment, CTM worked closely with travel suppliers, governments and industry innovators around the world. Its investment in building proprietary in-house technology has enabled CTM to quickly and easily adapt it’s tech stack and integrate emerging third-party data sources into itspre-trip planningandapproval workflows,online and mobile travel booking tools,risk identificationand communications platforms, andpost-trip reporting tools. CTM was one of the first travel management companies in the world to integrateUniversal Product Attributes (UPAs)into its proprietary online booking tool,Lightning, to provide users with real-time COVID-19 health and safety features direct from over 100 airlines globally within their flight search. Similar integrations have been deployed for hotel cleanliness programs. “We listened to our customers’ feedback, and it was clear they needed quick, reliable information relating to their ‘permission’ to travel. So we created a new COVID-Hub tool for our customers globally which integrates country and city level travel and health advice, border restrictions and quarantine requirements via an interactive global map and itinerary search to support highly efficient, reliable and responsible travel planning and duty of care” said Kubasik. Duty of care andtraveller wellbeingare now critical elements of any successful business travel program. With that in mind, CTM’s post-trip reporting tools enable businesses to easily identify travellers that may have been to a COVID hotspot, and its Traveller Wellbeing dashboards provide insight into the potential triggers of traveller fatigue.  “As a global company, we understand the local nuances of our regional markets as well as the unique travel needs and objectives of businesses across geographic location, industry and size” explains Kubasik. “As such, CTM has developed a global technology vision which is regionally adapted and deployed out of four regional tech hubs to meet those local market needs and nuances. These hubs ensure that we build client-facing technology in collaboration with our regional clients, employees and industry suppliers, aligned to local and regional market requirements. Those feedback loops are critical to the relevance and value of our technology offering. It also means that we can continue to adapt our technology to address changing travel environments and customer needs at maximum speed in every market we operate in.” Personalisation driving savings, adoption and compliance Personalisation is at the heart of CTM’s competitive proposition and underpins its service and technology strategy.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/guide-to-managing-traveller-risk/,"Guide to managing traveller risk  In today’s global climate, it is becoming increasingly important for businesses to be aware of, and plan for, potential risks to traveller safety. By engaging an experienced travel management company (TMC), developing a comprehensive travel policy, and leveraging a dedicated account management and consulting team, businesses can significantly reduce risk and maximise their travel investment. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) is committed to managing traveller risk and enhancing traveller safety. We have developed a range of advanced technologies and services to provide our customers with innovative risk management and duty of care solutions. Pre-Trip Approval CTM’s pre-trip approval tool, CTM Approve, provides businesses with complete visibility and greater control over their travelling workforce to maximise safety and savings. With highly customisable workflows and question logic, CTM Approve enables businesses to easily determine who can travel, where they can travel to, and when they can travel based on a wide range of risk considerations. Regulations can be automatically imposed to restrict travel based on country-specific risk ratings, and health and visa requirements to name a few, ensuring that all essential and non-essential travel is monitored. Additionally, travel bookings are withheld from ticketing until they have completed each step of the approval process. This ensures travel managers and travel bookers can review and, where necessary, reject travel requests that may pose risk to safety and duty of care obligations before payment is made, reducing risk and cost wastage.  Policy Restrictions When creating an effective travel policy, it is important to consider guidelines around prohibiting or limiting travel to countries or locations that are considered high-risk, or the use of non-preferred suppliers. When working with CTM, these policy conditions can be built into our customer’s travel program and reflected across online booking tools and mobile apps, as well as bookings via a travel consultant. Because our dedicated teams know your travel programs and objectives intrinsically, they will tailor travel solutions specifically to meet those needs. Stay in contact with your travellers Ensuring that your travellers receive credible, reliable and up-to-date information is critical to traveller safety. The CTM Portal has a dedicated live news feed, incorporating both travel alerts and your business’s own nominated communications in a single stream. The feed is dedicated to sharing travel alerts and other important travel communications. The CTM Mobile app also provides users with one-click ‘proof of life’ functionality, enabling businesses to check their travellers’ safety status with ease. Using the GPS location of the mobile device, once the traveller has checked in, or not checked-in, a notification is sent back to the risk manager to confirm their status.  Travellers should also be aware of where they can find information from government travel advisories. Risk Management Tools CTM provides risk management solutions tailored to our customers’ needs that help businesses identify travel risks and effectively track and communicate with their travellers in an emergency. CTM’s Traveller Tracker platform supports your duty of care program by tracking your travellers’ locations via their travel itinerary, anywhere in the world. Updated in real-time and fully integrated with the individual’s travel itinerary, CTM’s interactive global mapping tool provides an instant picture of country-by-country risk levels via a colour-coded map. Reports can be exported from the tool at the click of a button giving you relevant information at your fingertips when you need it. CTM Risk Alerts is a risk management dispatch solution keeping travellers abreast of developing travel risks by SMS or email as they happen. Configurable risk ratings match travellers with potential risks based on geographic location and pre-determined risk ratings, enabling easy and efficient notification of travel risks as they happen. Ensure your travellers are kept informed of breaking travel alerts withCTM Risk Alerts.  Your safety is our priority We understand that keeping people safe while travelling is the highest priority. To do this, businesses must understand and appropriately manage risk. Developing a strategic travel policy in partnership with your TMC is the best way to ensure your business travel objectives are achieved, your policy is adhered to and any potential risk is minimised. At CTM, our dedicated Client Value Managers design bespoke travel programs to meet any business travel objective, to ensure maximum safety, efficiency and value.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/seven-reasons-your-business-should-use-an-online-booking-tool/,"7 Reasons Your Business Should Use an Online Booking Tool Are you looking to improve the efficiency of your company’s travel policy? Perhaps you’re seeking a way to reduce your corporate travel spend? A centralised travel booking process provides significant advantages for businesses to improve their productivity and drive greater cost savings. Studies show that on average, business travellers carry four devices1. Therefore, it is increasingly important for companies to invest in travel technology that meets the needs of their business and travelling workforce. Whether you’re a travel booker, approver, traveller, or all three, anonline booking tool (OBT)can provide the perfect solution to your travel management needs. Below are a few of the many reasons why your business could benefit from utilising an OBT. 1. Save time and money Purchases made through OBTs incur lower fees than those made through travel agents. In addition, travellers are more likely to opt for a cheaper airfare if the cost difference is visually represented before them. This concept of ‘visual guilt’ can drive airfare savings of up to 10 per cent for businesses(2). Furthermore, some OBTs require travellers to submit a reason for choosing an airfare if it isn’t the cheapest available. The user is then accountable for any lost savings. OBTs also save time by streamlining the booking process. CTM’s proprietary OBT,Lightning, provides an end-to-end booking system, allowing users to book air, hotel and car hire all in one place, eliminating the need for multiple web pages and long phone calls. 2. Increase employee efficiency An OBT eliminates the need for an in-house travel booker, allowing PAs and EAs to focus on their day jobs. Leading travel management companies (TMCs), such as CTM, provide training to ensure everyone knows how to utilise the OBT’s features, so companies can be sure they are getting the most value from their travel management solution.Inbuilt approvalfeatures ensure no time and money is wasted on unapproved travel. This can be set up to allow different levels of authority for different users (bookers,approvers,travellers). Intuitive technology means all user information is stored within the OBT, leaving less room for error when it comes to entering frequent flyer numbers or spelling a traveller’s name correctly. 3. Bespoke service offering Corporate OBTs have evolved over the last few years and are now offering a personalised experience from top to bottom. CTM’s Lightning tool stores the required personal information for each traveller, such as unused ticket credits, frequent flyer information and preferred suppliers. Different filtering options allow for customised content display options. Whether you prefer your content displayed in lists or maps, you can personalise your display to what best suits your company. CTM’s Best and Rest Feature helps speed up the booking process even more, by bringing to the front of the screen hotels that are considered “the best”; preferred, recent stays or received a CTM SMART Review the last stay. 4. Ensure duty of care Pre-trip approvalfeatures ensure any risky or unconventional travel plans are shut down before they can be booked. Companies can designate different levels of approval and functionality to users. Responsibility is then delegated appropriately and decision-makers are held accountable for their travellers.Traveller tracking and risk alertsallow companies to easily locate and contact their people in a timely manner so as to warn them of any potential threats. Our OBT is highly configurable and can ensure 100% mandate to in-policy buying, such as airlines and hotels that meet your duty-of-care commitments. 5. Travel policy compliance Complete configuration of your company’s travel policy restricts users from booking travel that is not compliant. This may involve only showing content from preferred suppliers or removing options that are above price limits. If your company has negotiated rates with a supplier, CTM is able to upload these and any restricted bookings into your OBT. If required, it will trigger an approval request if the in policy options have sold out or don’t meet the specific travel needs. 6. Improve data capture and reporting Access to benchmarking data and travel reports provide regular guidance and advice on how to increase the value of your travel program. Advancedbusiness intelligencetools offer strategic account analysis to identify new savings opportunities and benchmark your contracts against similar companies. This ensures you receive the best possible deals. Booking all aspects of your travel in the one OBT ensures that all data is transferred to the reporting system, payment provider and risk provider. Plus, with CTM you get a bundled fee for air travel, hotel and car when booked in the same transaction. 7. Book on-the-go You no longer need to worry about spur-of-the-moment changes to travel arrangements. With the development of apps likeCTM Mobile, you can now take the functionality of your OBT on the go, with the full OBT experience replicated on your mobile device.

Business travel risk management outlook Business travellers should feel supported by their employer, whether travelling domestically or internationally, as no matter the destination they may be faced with unfamiliar environments which may have varying levels of risk.International SOS, a leader in international health and security risk management, predicts that: What remains certain is that prevention is better than a cure. Awareness of potential risks and plans to mitigate them is important for traveller health, safety and wellbeing, confidence, and business continuity. Organisations should review their travel risk policies and tools to determine if they are still fit for purpose. Having the righttechnologysolutions is important to support effective risk management policies to alert and inform impacted travellers and travel stakeholders, which is why working with a trusted travel advisor will be vital to support the overall risk management strategy. The objective is to be prepared for scenarios that could pose a risk to travelling employees, to ensure they can travel with confidence knowing that their safety, security and wellbeing are being considered at all points of their trip. Business travel duty of care An ISOS 2022 risk outlookreportreveals that: Theinternational organisation for standardisation(ISO) has created a framework to guide organisations in managing travel risks. TheISO 3130allows travel risk management adoption across a broad base of businesses of all sizes, including commercial businesses, not-for-profit and government. ISO states “Through more effective travel risk management, organisations will see fewer incidents occur while abroad, resulting in a better experience for the traveller.” CTM invested heavily in duty of care solutions for customers and understands the immediacy, reliability and 24-hour nature of this requirement; working withRiskline, to provide travel risk intelligence and real-time alert messaging before and during travel.

But risk management goes beyond that, where customers need to be thinking about risk mitigation, evacuations, and health for example. “Organisations should have a committee of people from various departments including HR and finance; a well-rounded stakeholder group to decide what their risk management plan and policy should be and how they wish to manage it.”  Risk management solutions Risk management solutions are designed to help organisations meet their duty of care obligations while providing business travellers with the confidence they need to make business travel safer, more productive and enjoyable.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/maximise-your-business-travel-budget-with-fare-forecasting/,"Maximise your business travel budget with Fare Forecasting Global travel prices are expected to increase throughout 2023, according to the 2023 Global Business Travel Forecast from GBTA. With primary drivers including fuel price hikes, labour shortages, and increased costs of raw materials, it’s a perfect storm for fare pricing. But there’s still an easy way to get the most out of your travel budget and secure the cheapest available airfare every time you travel. Cost reduction is a focus Demand for travel continues to boom. According to a 2023 Corporate Travel Management (CTM) global customer survey,customers are expecting to travel more (44.59%) or the same (49.08%) as they did in 2022 for customer meetings. Looking to the year ahead, the2023 Global Business Travel Forecastestimates that airfares will increase in 2023 by 8.45%, hotel rates by 8.2% and ground transportation by 6.8% year-over-year. The 2023 CTM Global Customer Survey indicated thatcost reduction is a top focus area for travel programs. With a spotlight on travel budgets and heightened pressure on Travel Managers to demonstrate a return on investment (ROI), customers can still find savings if they know where to look. It’s never been more important to get the best price for travel suppliers booked and demonstrate the ROI to the company. Simple adjustments to travel patterns can reap significant dividends to the company’s bottom line. That’s whereCTM’s Fare Forecastingtechnology can help. Simply enter your travel criteria to view the cheapest time to travel across surrounding days, within a single search.  Where can I save money? UsingCTM’s Fare Forecasterfeature, we analysed* the top routes across the US, Europe, Australia & New Zealand, and Asia. CTM found thatshifting an overnight itinerary by just 24-48 hours could regularly save business travellers upwards of 20%, and in some cases up to 50%, on their flight price.While not every trip can be moved to a different day, the savings on offer mean that even if a minority of travellers switch their travel dates by just one or two days the savings to an organisation’s travel budget will still have a positive impact. As an example, we found that it was possible to save between 13-21% on flights from Brisbane (BNE) to Sydney (SYD), and 8-22% on flights from Auckland (AKL) to Christchurch (CHC) for multiple travel dates across September through November 2023.  How does business travel Fare Forecasting work? CTM’s Fare Forecasterfeature is a proprietary development by CTM and is available in all regional markets we serve.Fare Forecaster displays the cheapest fares available 10-days on either side of your selected travel date, including your corporate travel deals, so you know you’re seeing all the options that matter. By maintaining an agile approach to our technology development, we’re able to continually add new content sources to make Fare Forecaster even more helpful in deciding when to travel. Fare Forecaster is built into theCTM Portalalongside a wide range of travel tools so you and your travellers have instant access to easily search for the best time to travel. Thanks to Fare Forecaster, travellers and travel bookers no longer have to keep multiple search windows open on their company booking tool, saving them both time when booking for themselves or on behalf of others. What is the best day of the week to travel? There is no one ‘best’ day of the week to travel as airfares will fluctuate based on carrier, routes, schedules, capacity and availability. The other new factor to be considered is that many organisations have moved to a hybrid work environment post-covid. Historical travel patterns have changed as a result, meaning that some of the limitations facing business travellers’ availability to travel in the past may be mitigated. Last-minute bookings and minimal flexibility were once the hallmarks of the road warrior; now there’s an opportunity to realign booking behaviour among your travellers as they have more lead time to plan office visits, client meetings and conference travel to ensure you get the most value for money from your travel program.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/maximise-your-business-travel-budget/,"Maximise your business travel budget Organisations have not wasted time getting back to business this year and as a result,global business flight bookings have exceeded pre-pandemic levelsaccording to an analysis by theMastercard Economics Institute. With a healthy return to business travel, organisations are reviewing their travel budgets and booking strategies to maximise their bottom line. Understand the new business travel landscape Comparing the average ticket price or daily hotel rates from 2020 to 2022 is no longer relevant in the fast-changing travel landscape. Many price-influencing factors are at play such as staffing, schedules, supply versus demand, inflation, and rising fuel prices. For organisations seeking to drive savings through their travel program, it is important to have an understanding of the current business travel landscape and the state of the travel supply chain which may impact pricing and will guide any necessary revision of travel budgets. Business travel budgets should take into account the current market conditions and as such, booking behaviours should be modified to maximise the return on investment.  How to reduce costs? Business travel budgets should not be viewed solely as a cost line, but rather as an investment in the organisation’s growing success and remaining competitive within its market. There are many ways organisations can take steps to reduce business travel costs without impacting the ability to travel and engage face-to-face. Here are just a few ways that organisations can maximise travel budgets and drive savings. Find savings from the expertise of a travel management company Partnering with a corporate travel management company (TMC) like CTM will help drive savings and efficiencies for organisations and their business travellers. Working with a dedicated strategic Account Manager enables an expert view over everything from supplier negotiations to the day-to-day operations of your travel team to traveller safety, travel program reporting and training. They work alongside your team, ensuring your travel arrangements are organised to meet all of your business needs, factoring in efficiency, safety, schedules and budget. Stuart Birkin, CTM’s Director of Strategic Client Partnershipsexplains“We are here to provide tailored travel management solutions to our customers which focus on driving value through savings, safety and efficiency. We do this through providing customer service excellence, innovative technology, and regular program review and optimisation strategies that take into consideration current and evolving market conditions to maximise opportunities. Cost savings is not solely about achieving the cheapest hotel rate or airfare; It is also about being able to demonstrate a return on investment. Did the organisation retain or win new customers, launch a new product, recruit and train more staff, or open new office locations as a result of the business travel? Did the business gains outweigh the expense? This is important as the cost of not travelling can be far greater.”  Travel policy compliance A well-designed travel policy can deliver significant savings. Consolidating your business travel spend into a limited number of preferred supplier partnerships, defining optimum booking behaviours based on your organisation’s unique travel needs, and encouraging product choices that align with traveller experience objectives are all ways to positively influence your budget. Maximising compliance with your organisation’s strategic travel policy is key to achieving efficiencies, cost savings and safety. Organisations that experience challenges with travel policy compliance can take measures to reduce out-of-policy bookings and lost savings. Amy Lloyd, CTM’s Head of Client Management, Western Australiasays “We encourage our customers to drive bookings via their chosen online booking tool (OBT) to support travel policy compliance. The OBT’s ability to capture reason codes for out-of-policy bookings is vital for compliance visibility and to aid future training, which CTM conducts as part of our strategic account plans at regular intervals throughout the year. This keeps Travel Managers informed of missed savings opportunities and keeps business travellers and Travel Arrangers informed and refreshed on travel policy best practices and changes.” Online booking tools and travel approvals Organisations that are not currently utilising anOBTmay be losing out on savings opportunities through inefficiencies and out-of-policy bookings.“Utilising a self-service corporate booking tool is an easy way to lower booking fees and improve productivity with access to all your policy-compliant content in one place”,saysCTM’s Head of Client Value Management – Asia, Molly Choi. Having your travel policy integrated into an OBT will reduce non-compliant bookings by only displaying travel content from preferred suppliers or those that meet applicable rate caps. An integrated pre-trip approval tool will also assist to minimise spending on unapproved travel activity while streamlining the booking and approval process for significant efficiencies.  Booking behaviour analysis No matter how large or small your business travel budget is, it is important to understand how to maximise those dollars with best practice booking behaviours. Are travel dates flexible, and do you have an easy view of pricing highs and lows to identify the cheapest time to travel? Are expensive flexible/refundable airfares being purchased unnecessarily when compared to the frequency of booking changes made? Booking cheaper/more restrictive airfares can present significant savings. What is the purpose of travel and how productive will the traveller be? Have they scheduled their day with meetings or events to maximise their time away and the travel budget spent? Did they book their travel in advance to leverage maximum availability and the lowest rates? Sarah Tauri, CTM’s Client Value Manager, Queenslandexplains“One factor that is currently influencing booking behaviour is the mass recruitment of new employees within organisations. This creates new and often non-compliant booking behaviours such as requesting new hotels, new locations and changes to advanced booking practices. Businesses should incorporate travel policy training into the new employee onboarding experience for relevant employees to ensure travel policy knowledge and booking behaviour expectations are delivered to maximise the travel budget.”  Unused travel credits Travel credits are a simple way to use the pre-spent travel budget for future flights. At the peak of the pandemic, organisations were forced to cancel large volumes of flights leaving high volumes of unused travel credits. Recommendation: Advanced purchase Business travel can be unpredictable. Where possible, it is recommended to book in advance to secure the best fare/rate of the day and maximum product choice. This is currently important with both domestic and international travel, as post-COVID travel demand may outweigh schedules and servicing. CTM’sFare Forecastertool assists businesses to achieve savings through better-informed decision-making at the time of booking.Fare Forecaster displays the cheapest fares available 10-days on either side of your selected travel date, including your corporate travel deals, so you know you’re seeing all the options that matter.This intuitive tool enables flexible business travellers to quickly and easily shift their travel plans to leverage the cheapest time to travel. Preferred suppliers A TMC should be able to analyse and review your business’s travel behaviours and spending patterns to get a comprehensive understanding of your specific travel trends and requirements. CTM specialises in strategicsupplier managementas a key component of travel budget optimisation.

Forecasting future travel spend in a fast-changing travel landscape might feel like you need a crystal ball, but with the right tools and data at your fingertips, you can be confident of making smart decisions that put you and your company in the control of your budget while maximising the return on your travel investment. But where do you start when you need to understand data across hundreds and thousands of bookings every month? That’s whereCTM Data Hubcomes into play. CTM Data Hub is a sophisticated travel data analytics platform, providing highly visual and easy-to-digest dashboard reports for at-a-glance program performance snapshots, coupled with the option to interrogate your data for in-depth program insights. And with predictive insights capability, you can experiment to see how policy changes today can impact your program’s performance in the future – making your travel budget predictions and policy recommendations both accurate and easy. Digestible data to understand travel spend and behaviour As one of the world’s largest travel management companies, Corporate Travel Management (CTM) uses big data to understand evolving market trends, build intelligent benchmarks, and accurately forecast for the future. We use a combination of individual reports and multiple dedicated dashboards to understand everything from advance purchase windows to KPIs and carbon emissions.   If you’re trying to understand online booking trends or just want to know what your sales team spent on flights last month, you can find it easily in CTM Data Hub. CTM pre-configures dashboards for you so you can get the most out of your data from day one. Each dashboard contains multiple layers of analysis that you can access in just one click. Quickly see which types of trips are booked at the last minute, or who’s continually booking out of policy so you can find ways to increase savings on business travel. Uncover actionable insights in your data with smart filters It is important to have a holistic overview of your company’s travel. Because we know business travel data has so many variable components, we make it simple for you to dissect your data right from within each dashboard report. Simply select from filters on the same screen, such as the reason for travel, department, project code or other custom parameters, to quickly obtain more granular data and understand the root cause of any change. Filters can be incredibly powerful. They help you paint a clear picture of how small changes can have an outsised impact on your business travel budget. It’s easier to influence booking behaviour changes with an under-performing team/department when you can demonstrate the impact of behaviours compared to their peers.   One global reporting hub for multi-regional travel programs Managing different data sets and tools for multi-regional travel programs can be challenging. With CTM Data Hub,Global Travel Managerscan get the full picture of their travel program’s data and performance in one global travel reporting tool, with consolidated travel data from both CTM-operated locations and our global partners. We collate and verify your global data, making it easy to review while also being able to filter and sort by region, country, division, or individual department codes. By understanding your regional and local travel trends within your travel program, you can better support your regional teams by making educated and relevant decisions relating to policy changes, adopting new tools or preferred partner agreements. Understand your environmental impact with Climate+ Sustainability is an increasingly importantfocus for our customers. Knowing the facts about what CO2 emissions are created from business travel activity and how different aspects of the travel program contribute to environmental impact are key to helping raise awareness and education within the travel buyer community. That same data is critical in helping our customers take actionable steps to reduce their environmental impact, like purchasing carbon credits, commonly known as offsetting, selecting travel suppliers based on the carbon impact of their services or their use ofsustainable aviation fuel(SAF). We show you CO2 emissions broken down by travel type and airline cabin class month-on-month as well as the average kg of CO2per trip and per traveller.    Use data to monitor business traveller wellbeing Taking care of business travellers is about more than meeting the legal requirements of your company’sduty of care. Even for the most seasoned road warrior, weeks away from home, early starts, red-eye flights, and timezone re-adjustments can have an impact on traveller well-being as well as their productivity and performance. CTM Data Hub arms you with the data you need to demonstrate to your HR team and other business leaders where individuals are potentially at risk, based on their travel behaviours. Understand who is at risk of fatigue or burnout by dissecting travel data by: Alongside these travel data metrics, we include a comprehensive guide to business traveller well-being so you can get started encouraging line managers and company leadership to take actionable steps that will ensure you havehappier, healthier travellerswho enjoy their role, deliver results, and reap the rewards that business travel presents.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/why-user-experience-ux-is-our-customers-number-one-priority/,"Pathfinders: User Experience (UX) is our customers' number one tech priority  In a Corporate Travel Management (CTM) survey of 500 customers, we asked what top three things they care most about when reviewing technology. A huge 61% chose “user experience”, with “speed” trailing at 12% and “functionality” and “reliability” sitting equally far behind on 10% each. So, what makes a great user experience? Let’s ask the experts. In the first of our new product leader series, Pathfinders, our regionaltechnologyleaders share their cutting-edge insights on what it takes to build technology for millions of users booking travel in every part of the world. What sets business travel technology apart from other software used today? Business travel by its very nature spans international borders and cultures, with the opportunity for fragmentation and inconsistency, but that shouldn’t apply to the user experience (UX), according to Brian Sheerin, CTM’s CTO EMEA. “There is a need forbooking toolsthat offer a common and easy to follow user interface (UI). Whilst there may be differences in regional content, such as airline fare types, consistency in the UI should be adhered to as closely as possible.” “The UI should be easy to follow, avoid acronyms and always help a buyer to find and purchase what they’re looking for as quickly as possible. A UX has to be created that provides access to everything from travel content to destination information, with minimal keystrokes, screens and removing unnecessary data entry.”  This focus on finding the right option as quickly as possible is a key differentiator in how business travel tools are used compared to the leisure traveller who, while in discovery mode, can be searching over an extended period of time, doing much more wish-listing than a business traveller who has particular constraints like destination, travel dates and accommodation providers. “Wherever possible, the UX should be personalised, recognising user details, needs and buying preferences. For business travellers, this means embracing travel policy, approval rules, risk and personal preferences in a simple, easy-to-use, speedy manner.” Average bookings costs in business travel are often 10 times the average order values (AOV) for other ecommerce verticals, with the average economy airfare USD$470compared to Amazon’s AOV of USD$36-60. This huge difference puts pressure on the user to get it right the first time, something Kenneth Wong, CTM’s CTO Asia is quick to point out. “Preventing errors is one of our key goals as designers. When users accidentally delete an item or make an unintended payment, their experience falls apart. Requiring confirmation for any important or irreversible action is one of the best ways to prevent these errors. This type of confirmation gives users an opportunity to reverse an unintentional action or to rethink something they’re not sure of.”  Are there times when business travel user challenges mirror those in other types of e-commerce or software? Timmo Rol, CTM’s Chief Product Officer ANZ certainly thinks so; “The CTM Product Development team are responsible for solving the user pain points and regardless of industry, users are the same everywhere; human (for now?). Not surprisingly, the problems are real problems that go beyond travel needs. Feedback such as “The information is unclear and I cannot decide what to purchase”, or “There are too many options for me to choose from, this is taking too long, I will complete my purchase later” resonates with anybody who has used an e-commerce product.. That is how our user-centric development approach adds value – if you can purchase a book on Amazon, you can book travel on Lightning.” Business travel has multiple stakeholders, how do you design digital experiences that have to work for different types of users? At CTM we use a variety of methods to better understand our customers and the different types of users of our products. Eric Ediger, CTM’s Executive Director, Product Development, North America, walks us through some of the different techniques we use to get to the heart of delivering a great user experience for our customers. “User personas help us understand and represent our user segments. We collect the data from user interviews and these personas, in turn, are used to guide UX decisions to fit with that segment’s needs.” “Empathy maps are another great way for us to put ourselves in the head of our customers, immersing us in what they think, feel, see, hear, say and do in relation to our products and services. They help add another layer that guides us towards success for the user.” As business travel is such a broad category with multiple users and types of products, from booking to risk management to data analysis, providing a level of visual consistency is also key according to Rol.. “We have a suite of in-house technology products, from our Online Booking Tool (Lightning) to our reporting suites, travel portal, traveller tracking and risk communications, invoices and profile management tools. Each product has different stakeholders that use it for different purposes. In addition, we have internal stakeholders with decades of corporate travel experiences that are valuable to our designs.  “We use a Design System with common visuals, guidelines and code components to keep the experience across products aligned. No matter if you are booking an international trip, then tracking risk and notifying your travellers in a specific location and later that same day reviewing your carbon budget reporting, the experience is familiar and intuitive.” How do you know when you’ve delivered a great user experience? “One of our key differentiators is our CTM UserLabs. Through user interviews and testing our designs and prototypes with users we capture the user requirements, understand the frictions in the user experience and solve for that. It guarantees our success of new features and products. Over time we have built up a healthy database of users across our stakeholder groups willing to contribute to our technology products. That way, our clients really have a seat at the table of our technology roadmap” says Rol. Talking to customers is equally high on the agenda for Lehi Mills,CTM’s Chief Product Officer, North America.“Continuous data-driven design, with improvements powered by user feedback, analytics and dogfooding gives us an edge.” ‘Dogfooding’ is the software development practice of being your own customers and using the products and tools you build for customers just as much internally. This approach served CTM well when developing our COVID-Hub, helping us pinpoint potential risks and navigating what data we needed on-screen to help users know what was possible, in order to make the right decisions about travel during the pandemic.  CTM COVID Hub, a dedicated tool for companies to assess current and emerging travel risks due to COVID-19 Booking travel online is 25 years old. How can you continue to reinvent and improve the experience? “Needs and expectations have changed radically in a post-Covid digital world and the paths we were on towards things like personalization and one-to-one experience have become radically accelerated,” said Mills. “Being responsive to changes has always been an essential element to remaining a leader in the digital travel landscape. Some key examples for us are our mobile redesign project that had to match the demand for a “touchless” experience. As travel is such a rapidly evolving landscape and new technology is driving change in so many ways, Wong is quick to point out that the key is continuing to focus on our customers. “We are on the lookout for industry and wider technology trends like multi-platform interactions, AI-powered chat, designing for speed, continuous user experience and inclusive design, but the main focus is always driving value to our customers.” Taking the friction out of the travel booking experience can often mean removing steps as much as making them faster or limiting choice. Our developers are experimenting with machine learning (ML) to simplify travel beyond what is possible today. Sheerin is excited about the possibilities that we’re creating for the next jump in travel innovation. “Solutions that require the traveller to just enter a date of travel and an arrival airport are already in place, and from this very basic information travellers can be provided with a whole trip itinerary, including travel to the airport or train station, air or rail travel, parking, lounges and accommodation.”  How does a better user experience add value to a company that’s evaluating different travel solutions? What travel stakeholders shouldn’t be mistaken about though is whether UX is applicable to all scenarios and products in business travel according to Mills. “You’re doing UX whether it’s intentional or not – focusing on simple and elegant solutions to user problems will create elements of trust and delight between user and product. “A lot of travel solutions are disjointed, disparate with options, and fail to provide the user with a smooth, seamless experience. Creating a cohesive, streamlined experience will ease a user’s ‘application agita’, or anxiety about learning a new tool when they just want to book travel and get on with their day”.  A great user experience not only makes the lives of business travellers free of technology fatigue, but it also has a real impact on efficiency and on a business’s bottom line adds Sheerin. “UX that minimises training, cuts booking errors, and sticks to policy with approval applied in an integrated manner helps make booking travel a pleasure. Simple, consistent UX encourages self-booking, lowering costs, risk, and policy enforcement without the need for costly offline administrative processes.” “User experience is about far more than just making things look good. A great user experience sits at the intersection of the user’s needs, the goals of the business, and what is technologically possible” claims Ediger. “Getting each of those right in tandem with each other brings tremendous value to an organisation.” Looking for a great booking UX?

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/pathfinders-microservices-for-maximum-travel-tech-agility/,"Pathfinders: Microservices for maximum travel tech agility  Taking anagile approach to technologydevelopment requires more than listening to customer feedback and having the desire to rapidly deploy new features and functionality. Without an underlying technology framework built to support rapid innovation, great ideas get stuck in a queue or lost in amongst larger platform updates. At CTM we leverage microservices to power much of our technology stack. It means we can quickly make an update to one element of one product, such as how airline amenities are displayed in Lightning, without having to rebuild our whole flight search engine. In this episode ofPathfinders: Microserviceswith CTM’s global technology leaders, we give you a primer on what microservices are, why they matter for travel program managers, and how you can take advantage of them in building the perfect travel tech stack for your organisation.  What are microservices and where did they come from? If you’ve ever played Jenga, you know something about the risks of messing around with the foundational blocks of traditional business software. Legacy applications can support the addition of new blocks on top, provided they go in the same upward direction, but if you try and change something halfway down, or worse at the very foundation of your stack, it’s time to worry. Microservices don’t need to sit on top of each other, and you can build them in an interconnected lattice, much like the apps on your smartphone. Some share data with each other but you can add, delete, or update them as you please without worrying what the others will do.  Where did microservices come from? Microservices as a concept appeared in the 2000s, with professor Dr Peter Rogers using the term“Micro-Web-Services”at a cloud computing conference in 2005. Around the same time, large global technology companies and smaller start-ups began adopting elements of microservice architecture to their operations to become less reliant on large Jenga-like technology structures that were slow and difficult to update. At its simplest, microservices are anapproach to building softwareapplications that breaks them down into a suite of smaller services, with separate processes that run independently while easily communicating with each other. Today companies like Google, Amazon, PayPal, Tencent, Spotify and thousands of others use microservices to innovate at massive scale and speed simultaneously. Netflix is a big proponent of microservices and has dedicated groups ofmicroservices for everythingfrom billing your credit card to how your watch history helps recommend new content to you. Now it’s time to quiz our own microservice architects on how they are helping change travel technology for the future. Do microservices lend themselves to types of applications or even industries more than others? Timmo Rol, CTM ANZ’s Chief Product Officerexplains,“Every business and industry have its own challenges and opportunities and whilst it may seem insignificant, your choice of architecture can determine your success in the market. Microservices architecture can be useful in any industry, but CTM has achieved economies of scale that we need throughout our continuous growth.” “Our architecture is particularly suitable for us because of the high amount of third-party integrations underpinning our applications – you can’t have a flight search platform likeLightningwithout integrations with airlines and other intermediaries. It’s provided with a flexible basis and is the backbone of our Content Factory to drive economies of scale and deliver the right content to the right customer anywhere in the world.”  CTM Asia’s CTO, Kenneth Wongis also positive about the benefits; “Microservices are used successfully across all industries but lend themselves best to rapidly changing industries such as travel, where tech needs to be updated and deployed monthly, especially in the current post-pandemic climate.” “Of course, for CTM we have the opportunity to leverage a microservices architecture because we build and own our proprietary technology products. Wherever we need to integrate with one or more third-party technology products to suit a customer, we can develop a microservice to deliver ease of integration, flexibility in business rules, and bespoke personalisation and configuration opportunities that make it more valuable to the client,” adds Rol. What are some of the benefits of using microservices at the TMC level in travel distribution? CTM EMEA Chief Technology Officer, Brian Sheerinsees microservices as a direct boost to customers;“The main benefits of using a microservice approach are the speed of new developments and the ease of deployment. Smaller structured services allow for easier addition and maintenance of features and rapid deployment, reducing turnaround time on client requests and enhancing our ability to be agile and first to market.” “For CTM, the benefits of using microservices are directly aligned to our company values, customer service, ROI and innovation,”saysLehi Mills, CTM’s Chief Product Officer for North America. “The use of microservices allows flexibility and surface information where it’s most suitable to the customer needs. OurCTM Portalmay not be an application to make a booking, but the ability to surface fares inFare Forecasterfrom the same source as Lightning, allows the user to save by planning before booking. “We use risk alerts and notifications for travellers on the road, but other applications benefit from the same services as providing risk transparency as part of the approval process is crucial too. Lastly, microservices allow us to work with multiple teams in parallel without impacting or being dependent on each other. This speeds up our innovation and reduces breaking changes in our deployments.” Should travel program managers be bringing in their product and IT people into TMC conversations to get more microservices expertise in the room when evaluating TMCs, if so why? CTM’s Chief Technology Officer, EMEA’s Brian Sheerinis adamant it’s something buyers need to be aware of, “Yes, Travel Program Managers must understand what tech is “under the hood” to ensure rapid development to support changes in industry needs requiring new features or updates to existing functionality. We’ve all seen how quickly travel can be turned upside down, you need to know your agency can respond quickly and if necessary, get help verifying that from your colleagues. Microservices allow for this rapid development and support a truly agile methodology when done right.”  “Travel buyers have seen their influence and responsibilities grow since 2019. By understanding the microservices a TMC has and stimulating conversations with their technology teams, they not only grow their value to their company, but they can help sow the seeds for true collaboration at the technology layer, providing more valuable and personalised services to their people in their travel program,” adds Mills. Are microservices limited to proprietary technology a company sells to customers or can they be used in other ways to benefit travel programs? CTM ANZ’s Rolsees multiple opportunities for different types of benefits from microservices; “Sharing their travel data in useful ways with buyers and enabling self-service capabilities remains one of our principles. Whether the clients take raw data, we provide flexible reporting or we create features, widgets, tools and applications that leverage the data based on client requirements, it’s all possible within our client solutions.” “Proprietary tech in travel still connects to multiple industry suppliers and partners. Their ability to interact with our microservices and we with theirs enhances the ability to deliver. The more we can do behind the scenes with technology for our travellers, the more seamless travel can be.” addsCTM EMEA’s Sheerin. Do you expect to see more adoption of microservices in other areas of travel, such as airline fare distribution or payment? CTM Asia’s Wong is confident we will; “Yes, global suppliers are already moving to a microservice infrastructure for the reasons outlined above which will make it easier for our proprietary tech to interact with them and help us move even faster.” CTM’s Global Chief Technology Officer, Mike Kubasikhad the last word to say on how microservices are changing travel tech; “As the travel industry moves to a service-oriented architecture (SOA) of microservices and APIs, we’re in a great position at CTM to adapt quickly to the marketplace and leverage the many APIs of third-parties and even our customers to build what they need.” Enjoyed this edition of Pathfinders: Microservices?

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/pathfinders-agile-technology-at-a-global-scale/,"Pathfinders: Agile technology at a global scale  When was the last time you made a suggestion to a software provider that actually got included on an upcoming roadmap, never mind the feature being built and released? Despite massive reductions in the cost and speed required to build, test and deploy software in the past ten years, many companies still struggle to support their customers with the fast and timely release of new products and features to drive value. The critical requirements of getting quality products to market at speed include building strong customer feedback loops, connecting product teams with stakeholders, and maintaining a modern and agile technology architecture – but that’s not all. In episode 2 of Pathfinders, our technology leadership series, we uncover what agile development means and how it helps CTM build the features and products that our Australia and New Zealand business travel customers want, while still staying aligned on core areas of focus across our global business. Software development in the modern age of business travel technology Before we dive into the thoughts and advice from our team on building travel software with an agile approach, let’s quickly break down some of the well-known methodologies used to build software, regardless of the field: Waterfall Waterfall behaves like it sounds, with products and features cascading down in a straight linear path, making it powerfully focused but tough to redirect.Scoping and feature planning is predefinedbefore any development begins, meaning this fixed approach can lead to long development cycles and minimal chance to incorporate customer feedback until it’s too late. Feature-Driven-Development (FDD) FDD takes the broad scoping of Waterfall and breaks it out into separate features, with the first 3 of 5 phases devoted to deciding on the overall model or product scope, the list of features required and then a development plan. Phases 4 and 5 split out the designing and building of individual features, allowing teams to act independently and launch specific features faster. Agile Driven by continuous testing and actively sourcing feedback from stakeholders and users, agile is focused on short 1-3 weeks sprints throughout the ideation, prototype, build, test and iterate phases. Agile helps teams hone in on the ideal solution to a customer need or pain point by including them in the development process and adjusting courses based on insights learned from testing and feedback. DevOps Short for “Development Operations”, the emphasis is on building systems to support the continuous deployment of new features and changes. DevOps is highly geared towards maximising efficiency and identifying programable processes. DevOps is the newest of the four highlighted methodologies but overlaps with agile.CTM technologyutilises agile methodology with a blend of DevOps engineering for maximum efficiency.  How Lightning strikes in CTM’s regional technology centres CTM’s global technology and product leadership team share their thoughts on how implementing agile methodology across a blended global and regional technology strategy delivers value for businesses and their travellers.  How does CTM’s approachtotechnology roadmaps differ from other business travel management companies (TMCs) or other businesses of a similar scale? CTM’s Global CTO, Mike Kubasik, explains the value of a multi-layered roadmap when developing at a global scale; “CTM’s technology vision combines the best of both worlds: a globally designed technology strategy and development roadmap, supported by tailored regional solutions and agile development methodology to meet the needs and nuances of every region we operate in. This multi-layered approach ensures our customers of every size, industry and geographic location enjoy access to the most relevant and intuitive travel tools at maximum speed.” Brian Sheerin, CTM’s CTO EMEA, is unequivocal about the benefits to CTM’s customers; “We combine an agile methodology with a real desire to deliver to market with maximum speed and efficiency, meaning we get comprehensive solutions to our clients when they need them to deliver maximum gains. This was particularly evident during the pandemic; whilst others debated what was needed, we were already delivering it and then adding further functionality in subsequent releases.” CTM’s Chief Product Officer AU/NZ, Timmo Rol, makes the case that proprietary ownership of business travel technology makes a big difference to the roadmap; “Our roadmap spans across multiple products, allowing us to find innovative solutions across the entire travel workflow. From pre-travel research inCTM’s COVID Hubandpre-trip approval toolstoinnovative forecastingto ensure the best fares, fast and efficient (and policy-compliant) bookings via theLightning online booking toolandmobile app, topost-trip reporting,sustainabilityand wellness insights –we design and integrate our technology holistically across the entire trip management process.” What part does customeranduser feedback have in the CTM development process? “In the development process at CTM, feature requests are fed directly from the customer to the regional technology team so that we can react much more quickly, and our solutions are more ‘to the point’ thanks to early customer influence on our roadmap and development,” says Kenneth Wong, CTM’s CTO Asia. The proof of CTM’s success with agile comes straight from our clients; “Onceagain, I am impressed with CTM’s response to the pandemic crisis and how quickly CTM [was] to advance your technology to enable your clients to navigate through different situations so efficiently.” – Category Manager, CTM Client How does being agile across 4 regional tech hubs differ from other companies with one tech team? CTM’s Chief Product Officer for North America, Lehi Mills, feels the blend of global strategy and regional deployment combined with our agile approach gave CTM the edge over teams adding features in phases during 2020;“Our 4 tech hubs allowed us to deliver new global business travel tech solutions, such as our COVID Hub and Universal Product Attributes in Lightning, while concurrently designing and developing regional tech solutions that delivered on specific regional travel challenges during the pandemic. This meant that we were able to quickly put COVID restriction guidance and airline safety measures into the hands of both travel managers and travellers within a matter of weeks, rather than months.” How has Corporate Travel Management’s (CTM’s) product development process adapted over the past 18 months? “Through the acquisition of Tramada, we now have the ability to resolve business problems across the full supply chain and are not restricted by third party technology anywhere. This has already provided synergies in features and we continue to focus on efficiency, productivity and functionality enhancements across products”, says Rol. In the US, Mills is excited by improved processes that are driving greater productivity gains for the tech teams; “CTM has always followed an agile methodology. The biggest change over the last 18 months has been how we utilise DevOps engineers to do code releases and support the engineering team more efficiently. This separation of responsibilities between engineers and dev ops helps maintain our various compliances and helps enforce security, data privacy, and risk mitigation,helping our product delivery teams move faster and get value to the customer rapidly.” If you’d like to see for yourself what the fruits of agile labour can be for a modern business travel program, get in touch today for a demo ofCTM’s proprietary booking tool for business travellers.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/the-future-airport-experience-a-return-to-business-travel-post-covid-19/,"The future airport experience: business travel post COVID  As the travel industry shifts from emergency response to preparation for re-entry, we take a look at what the airport environment may look like in a COVID-19 recovery era, and whatbusiness travellerscan expect to experience when they next fly. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) recently conducted a global customer survey to understand the key issues and concerns facing businesses and their travellers as they prepare for a return to business travel. A recurring theme across our survey findings was thefuture airport experience– from terminal cleanliness to security and health screening, social distancing to lounge access and many more questions in between. In this blog, we summarise some key recommendations from peak global travel and airport associations to support the safety, efficiency and confidence of travellers with the future airport experience as we prepare for the ‘new normal’ in business travel. Restarting aviation The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has outlined three key requirements and stakeholder groups to successfully restart aviation: Airport terminal access Some airports are implementing restricted airport access to workers, travellers and accompanying persons (for example those assisting passengers with disabilities, reduced mobility or unaccompanied minors). General guidance is: do not travel to the airport unless you are travelling.  Health screening Health screening is a major talking point for governments, airports and travel operators and can take a variety of forms, from pre-departure traveller declarations to on-site airport screening. IATA recommends thathealth screening measures should be introduced as ‘upstream’ as possible, enabling travellers to arrive at the airport ‘ready to travel’ and therefore minimising risk of contagion at airports. Many airlines have introduced pre-departure online health screening declarations for travellers to complete prior to arrival at the airport. Similarly, IATA recommends that any measures that need to be applied during the travel process should be applied prior to departure rather than on arrival. This includes temperature screening at terminal building entry points, conducted by professionally trained staff, to determine if passengers are fit to fly. London Heathrow Airport (LHR) is an example of a major international airporttrialling large-scale temperature checksby carrying out testing at departure gates for passengers departing to destinations where this is a requirement. Additionally, IATA notes “When proven and available at scale, testing for COVID-19 or immunity passports could also be included as temporary biosecurity measures.” In April, Emirates became thefirst airline to conduct on-site rapid COVID-19 tests, implementing a quick blood test for international travellers flying from Dubai to Tunisia. Results were available within 10 minutes of the test. “We are working on plans to scale up testing capabilities in the future and extend it to other flights, this will enable us to conduct on-site tests and provide immediate confirmation for Emirates passengers travelling to countries that require COVID-19 test certificates”, said Adel Al Redha, Emirates Chief Operating Officer. Check-in In general, most airports are not currently advising travellers to arrive earlier than normal for their departing flight, howeverCTM recommends travellers verify check-in times prior to travelin case this advice changes with growth in passenger movements. IATA recommends that passengers should complete as much of the check-in process as possible before arriving at the airport to minimise time spent at the airport. This includesmobile or home printed boarding passes and bag tags, and personal data captured online where possible. Baggage drop-off Passengers can expect to see an increased use of self-service baggage solutions (such as baggage drop), where available, to minimise physical interactions between passengers and airport staff. Airport security & screening Passengers may experience an increase intouchless technology and biometricsduring security and screening. This may include electronic declarations (eg mobile and QR codes) and contactless processes such as ePassport chip reading and facial recognition to limit hand-to-hand contact.  Physical distancing Physical distancing throughout the airport’s facilities will need to be implemented in line with local rules and regulations and should be designed to maximise passenger flow through the terminal – from check-in, immigration, security, departure lounge to boarding. Where possible, airports may seek to avoid side-by-side gating for aircraft boarding to allow guests more distance within the boarding lounge. Boarding Travellers can expect to see moreself-serve scanning stationsduring the boarding process to minimise physical handling of boarding passes. Additionally, many airlines are transitioning to aback-to-front boardingprocess based on assigned seating rows to better manage the flow of passenger traffic from airport to aircraft. Cleaning Airports are implementing new and innovative cleaning measures to minimise risk of contagion, increase efficiency and improve traveller comfort and confidence in the airport environment.Pittsburgh International Airport (PIA)is amongst those trialling the use of autonomous robots for cleaning purposes, while Hong Kong International Airport has rolled outfull-body disinfectant booths that sanitise passengers’ clothing and bodies in 40 seconds. IATA’s guidance states “In observance of local rules and regulations, airlines, airports and governments need to cooperate to ensure that equipment and infrastructures are sanitised and hydroalcoholic gel is easily made available. The frequency of the sanitising should be established, communicated, and appropriate resources need to be put in place to enforce it. This applies to such items as carts, trolleys, e-gates, self-service kiosks, fingerprint readers, wheelchairs, trays, used medical masks disposal container, on-board equipment, etc.” Baggage claim and customs Speed and efficiency in the baggage claim process is a key area of focus to support social distancing and limit physical interaction. Where possible, airports may make use ofmore baggage carousels per flight arrivalto allow for greater physical distancing. It will also be critical that the customs clearance process is as speedy as possible whilst maintaining the highest levels of security. According to Airports Council International (ACI), “Airports need to accelerate the digitalisation for all the touchpoints of the customer journey. Improving the movement of travellers through the border will reduce passenger stress, for instance. Technologies such as e-gates, biometrics, and CT scanners might help in this process too.” In summary... This is a fast-changing landscape where guidance, solutions and levels of adoption may change regularly and will vary across regions and suppliers. There are still many unknowns regarding the post COVID-19 travel environment. Governments, travel industry bodies, suppliers and travel agencies continue to work hand-in-hand to design and deliver effective solutions that will support safety, peace of mind and value for businesses and their travellers to support economic recovery whilst minimising risk.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/corporate-travel-agency-data-travel-programs/,"How corporate travel agency data can transform travel programs  Travel Managers are busier than ever with52% spending more time on data analysis or reporting than they did pre-pandemicaccording to aGlobal Business Travel Association (GBTA)report[1]. With so much time spent on analysis, it is vital businesses have access to the right corporate travel agency data solutions to provide real-time insights into their corporate travel. Big data, data analytics, or in our case, CTM Data Hub, consists of large volumes of data which is analysed and presented to reveal key trends and patterns. It allows companies to delve deep into theirtravel reportingto not only identify large areas of spend, but to provide recommendations and in-depth solutions for better spend management. It’s a step-up from traditional, passive data interpretations and a step towards strategic decision making based on predictive analytics. In other words, it allows us to become ‘data storytellers’. To explain,Corporate Travel Management’s (CTM’s) Head of Business Intelligence, Kevin Petre, gives five examples of how Travel Managers can optimise corporate travel agency data reporting to transform their travel program. 1. More strategic supplier negotiations Traditionally, supplier negotiations take place on an annual or bi-annual basis and involve discounting the average fare based on the previous year’s volume. CTM Data Hub instead allows Travel Managers to look ahead, with predictive forecasting and travel trend analysis to easily identify future booking behaviours. It draws information from multiple sources (GDS and partner agencies), giving Travel Managers complete visibility of program spend. This can be shared with preferred suppliers to negotiate more accurate rates. “As a Travel Manager, you can track spending across your primary suppliers and leverage that information to renegotiate more favourable contracts when thresholds are surpassed to your business’s advantage.” You can also assess each airline’s average selling price (ASP) for specific routes and class types. As a bonus, CTM Data Hub is configured for global businesses, acting as a single, global reporting hub for multi-region travel programs. Travel Managers can leverage this information to negotiate supplier deals on a global scale by aggregating their data and demonstrating the leverage with suppliers to potentially shift market share. 2. Managing global or multi-region programs At CTM we operate across four continents, with our people travelling to countries all over the world. Data is a crucial part of running our business, and travel is no different. We leverage CTM Data Hub’s ability to scale across territories with location and department-based filtering to easily identify trends, opportunities for savings, or differences between travel patterns in our organisation. Travel Managers can do the same no matter how many countries they manage travel in and how those business units are structured. “You can see which country is booking last-minute or not booking preferred suppliers, and share best practice advice to regional team leads on cost savings and traveller wellbeing by pointing out a higher-than-average number of weekend and overnight flights their division is booking. “It’s designed for growing businesses that operate anywhere in the world, and it helps make data-driven decisions to support your global travel program.”  3. KPI tracking Corporate travel can be considered one of the largest expenditures for businesses. Therefore, setting and tracking specific KPIs via corporate travel agency data to support your overall business plan is essential when demonstrating the success of your travel program. CTM Data Hub can be useful in understanding employee behaviour and why exceptions are occurring. It offers an opportunity to set and track KPIs to increase policy compliance, such as limiting business class to certain distances or routes and reducing environmental impact. Another example is improving hotel compliance. Hotel spend offers the biggest opportunity for savings with supplier negotiations but is often overlooked. CTM’s Data Hub provides accurate hotel information, allowing travel managers to benchmark against previous months and strive for improved future rates. 4. Encouraging sustainable travel Travel Managers (38%) said in a GBTA[1]report that sustainability metrics are more important than cost metrics when evaluating travel program success. Businesses are facing continual pressure to reduce their environmental impact, and as a result, have become increasingly concerned with monitoring their travel habits. In response, CTM Data Hub provides multi-level reporting on carbon emissions. There is also the ability to calculate carbon offsetting, and an opportunity to work with CTM’s sustainability solutions provider to offset emissions. “We’re providing more than just off-the-shelf carbon reporting. Clients can drill down into the specifics of their footprint, measuring the difference between cabin class, route, transport method, and more.” Furthermore, reducing spend on certain routes can be resolved through traveller tracking information. By reviewing past, present, and future traveller movements, companies can avoid unnecessary transport costs by leveraging travellers on confirmed trips to pick up packages in an area they are travelling to, support a local meeting, or drop by to see a client nearby.  5. Enhancing user experience Contrary to popular belief, in-depth data analysis doesn’t need to be overwhelming. CTM’s Data Hub is presented through customisable dashboard reports, which show easily digestible information across a full range of travel spend and behaviour. This allows even the biggest opposer of data analytics to visualise and dissect complex data in a single click. “Providing data reporting that our clients will find useful was our main objective. We firmly believe that data can only be effective when it is clear and understandable.” The reports can be customised for different authority levels within the business, which means relevant data is readily available for those who need it. “The capacity to delve precisely into particular departments, cost centre’s, and even types of travellers (staff or guest) is what sets CTM Data Hub apart from the rest.Our ability to carefully consider and act on customer feedback enables us to deliver the most valuable travel program optimisation tools.” At CTM, we believe that better insights lead to better business travel; that’s why CTM Data is having a huge impact on how we manage our travel programs in 2023 and beyond.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/flight-health-and-safety/,"CTM launches integrated airline reassurance data into Lightning online booking tool  As domestic travel restrictions begin to ease around the world, access to health and safety insights will be key to the resumption of business travel activity, according to global customer research conducted byCorporate Travel Management(CTM). Australian states and territories will begin assessing their interstate travel restrictions from mid-June, with most expected to be eased by the end of the July-September quarter, while New Zealand commenced easing restrictions last week allowing domestic travel to resume. This week, CTM launched integrated airline reassurance data into its proprietaryonline booking tool Lightning, enabling CTM’s customers globally to view COVID-19-related airline service features alongside flight search results at the time of booking. The airline data, powered by ATPCO’s Routehappy Rich Content, incorporates new Reassurance UPAs (Universal Product Attributes) from more than 100 airlines (representing over 70% of global flight schedules), including Air New Zealand. Qantas’ new Fly Well program, announced yesterday, includes a range of wellness features which will be reflected in their Reassurance UPA’s in coming weeks and made available inLightning. The data spans health and safety measures such as airport and cabin cleaning, health screening, food and beverage hygiene, passenger and crew wellbeing, as well as flexible booking conditions. CTM CEO Australia and New Zealand, Greg McCarthy said that CTM has responded quickly to customer feedback, integrating an extra layer of travel intelligence into its proprietary booking technology to allow customers to make more informed choices and feel confident about their return to business travel. “Our survey data clearly showed the negative impact that not travelling is having on our customers’ business performance, and we understand the challenges they now face in getting their teams back on the road with maximum safety and peace of mind. “As Australia looks towards easing domestic travel restrictions in the coming months and New Zealand prepares for a return to domestic travel, we’re thrilled to be able to deliver enhanced service information from a significant number of airlines to help our customers make travel decisions that will increase traveller confidence and aide business recovery at the earliest opportunity,” he said. Seth Anagnostis, Head of Global Sales at ATPCO said, “It’s important to see more companies like CTM acting quickly to address the travel concerns of their customers globally and provide them with the information they need to get back to flying with maximum confidence. Partnering with CTM on their global roll-out of ATPCO’s Reassurance UPAs within the Lightning online booking tool is another step forward for consumer confidence.”"
https://au.travelctm.com/blog/travel-approval-processes/,"The best travel approval processes for your business With contributions fromJonathon Mavin, Product Manager AU/NZ Mirroring an overall industry trend, over the past 12 months, 56% of bookings through CTM’s online booking tool Lightning have required approval, either active (pre-trip) or passive approval. While many companies are now opting to allow staff to book their own business travel, it’s clear there is still a level of oversight businesses need to ensure that travel is booked in-policy and the cost centre can be specifically monitored. With the right technology implemented, a decentralised travel booking approach with an appropriate approval process can simplify the booking process for business travellers, while continuing to ensure in-policy bookings and policy adherence. Centralised vs Decentralisation A traditional centralised booking process places the power to book and approve travel requests in the hands of a key group of a business’s administrative staff or specific bookers. This approach is often favoured by business as it allows for high levels of control and oversight over travel bookings, policy and budget. Contrastingly, a decentralised approach gives your travellers the ability to make their own business travel bookings. With the improvements of policy controls in booking technology, many organisations with a younger or predominately mobile staff base, who are used to booking things themselves, are beginning to favour this approach. Should you choose to follow a decentralised booking approach it’s important to assess what approval process is best for your business, be it no approvals or an active pre-trip or passive approval system that can be specifically configured based on company travel policy. Configure approval system to policy requirements When implementing a decentralised booking process, your chosen corporate online booking tool should still support your company’s varying business travel policy requirements to make bookings and approval simple i.e. role type, reason for travel, country pair, supplier choice, fare class and ‘Days In Advance’ booking policy, each producing a variety of triggers. The online tool can be configured to either restrict any out-of-policy behaviour or provide some room for movement.  Active approval Active (pre-trip) approvals still require direct approval from the travel or line manager for the booking to be ticketed. This notification is sent via email to the approver and the approver can approve or decline by simply clicking the link within the email; no need to log-in. With active approval there is a reliance on the approver to act within the ticketing time limit, this can be as short as the same day. If this is missed the lowest prices can be lost and bookings need to be requested again. To help combat this areminder emailnotification is also be sent to the approver to remind them of travel requests before the ticketing window closes, helping to ensure that best fares are not lost due to oversight.  Passive approval With a lean toward a decentralised booking approach, many companies are recognising the benefits in a passive approval model for their travel bookings. At CTM we have seen an uptake in passive approvals by 30% over the last financial year. A passive approval process can save time for approvers and bookers while ensuring that the best fares and urgent bookings are not lost. Due to the highly configurable nature of the CTM’s Lightning online booking tool, with a passive approval process, companies can choose to allow all in policy bookings to be automatically approved, safe in the knowledge that these bookings are within the company’s travel policy. To maintain oversight, notifications of bookings can be sent to the selected “approver” once bookings are made, ensuring all required facets of the business remain informed.  Approvals in Booking Technology At CTM our commitment to innovation and providing a return on investment for customers means we are continuously driven to providing speed, accessibility and ultimately peace of mind. CTM’s Lightning online booking tool, and CTM Mobile, offers the following features, and more, to address several pain points in the approvals process: CTM Mobile is one of the only corporate booking apps developed specifically for arrangers and travellers to make complete bookings on the go, while also offering full in-trip services, To further support an easier travel approvals process In-App approval is coming soon to CTM Mobile; here the approver can review and action travel requests all from within the mobile app. You can find out more about Lightning and CTM Mobile’s approvals, and which features are best aligned with your business goals, by speaking with a CTM Business Analysis and Solutions manager.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/what-is-travel-really-costing-your-business/,"What is travel really costing your business? For many businesses, the true cost of employee travel can be hard to quantify. Unlike set costs, such as payroll and other regular operating expenses, there are various direct and indirect factors that contribute to the real cost of travel for your business. Time to book, supplier rates and access to technology can all impact your bottom line. Similarly, businesses both large and small can feel the effects of unmanaged travel programs, with out-of-policy travel often being the main contributor to out-of-control spending. That’s why at CTM we offer a full analysis of your businesses travel costs. Within this analysis, we consider all aspects, directly and indirectly, related to the costs of travel to help you decipher if your travel program is providing the best value and is fully optimised for cost avoidance. Here we cover a few points to consider when reviewing your business travel and creating a travel program. 1. Time How many hours per week are you paying staff to book travel? Booking travel is not always straight forward. There is the initial search for price and availability, the consideration of alternative travel days and then a price comparison between multiple suppliers before an itinerary is finalised. Industry knowledge also tells us that most “travel bookers” are usually employed for other administrative tasks, thus they’re taking time away from other important duties and hindering their efficiency across the board. Therefore, an important indirect cost of booking to review is your ‘employee cost per hour’. In our experience, most people booking travel within New Zealand and Australian businesses work within the roles of Personal Assistant, Executive Assistant and Office Manager, with the average hourly rate for these positions being close to $30p/h. For business in which each employee books their own travel that average hourly rate could increase. Introducing a travel management company (TMC) and an online booking tool such asLightningcould reduce your employee’s booking time from over half an hour to under three minutes, reducing the cost of booking significantly. By recognising the hidden complexities and the true cost of time when booking travel across various channels, businesses can look to ways to better optimise their travel programs. Introducing purpose-built technology, to consolidate and streamline the flight, hotel and car booking process, and using the expertise of experienced travel consultants, businesses can foster greater productivity from staff; by allowing them to spend less time booking travel and remain focused on other important job functions. OurSMART Calculatoruses information collected through our industry experts to provide you with a guide to how much you could be saving with a TMC managed program. 2. Supplier value How can you be sure you are getting the best value with flights, hotels and car hire? Booking on consumer websites or direct may mean your company is not receiving the best corporate rates and add-ons. Working with a TMC, such as CTM, allows you to take advantage of their global buying power as well as specially negotiated rates and add-ons that are unavailable to the general public, such as theCTM Preferred Hotel Program. A TMC can also assist you in direct negotiations with suppliers and will ensure your agreed rates and discounts are applied to each of your bookings, either when booked via the TMCs online booking tool or via a consultant. A travel policy that requires employees to book travel through a TMC ensures there are no missed opportunities for savings due to the employees booking directly and missing out on negotiated rates. For every dollar your business spends on booking and managing your travel program, you should be able to see a positive return in cost savings through negotiated supplier rates and enforceable policy controls. If you’re paying more to book and manage your travel program than you’re saving it might be time to talk to an experienced TMC.  3. Access to technology Intuitive technology tools that create a positive end-user experience for your travellers and bookers is an important consideration when it comes to developing a budget-friendly travel policy. Without an internal approval system, often a time-consuming process itself when done offline, businesses who allow staff to book business travel directly can find they are subject to a significant degree of out-of-policy booking costs. Technology and user-friendly online booking tools, such asLightningandCTM Mobile, offering 24/7 accessibility, inbuilt booking and policy controls andapproval systems, can save your company thousands of dollars per year on out-of-policy bookings. Do you have easy access to your travel program’s expense data? If you are not leveraging this information into go-forward travel policy strategies you may risk advancing overall program goals, continued leakage, poor program visibility and increased cost. Furthermore, access to frequently updated pre-ticketing data allows you to capture and respond to policy breaches before they happen, helping to reduce spend and improving policy compliance. Data Analysis tools such asCTM SMART Dataprovide all of this along with an easy to digest visual representation of your corporate travel program’s performance. You can access your businesses travel data online at any time, including air, car hire and hotel bookings, with a wide variety of search options available.Forecasting, benchmarking and hypothetical data inputs also allow you to see how changes to your travel program could optimise costs and savings in the future.  The answers, or lack thereof, to these three considerations, may indicate the perfect time for your business to engage with a TMC for one or a multiple of reasons. A good TMC can help your business streamline processes and develop a travel policy that drives savings through greater buying power, leading technology solutions and access to expert support teams and account management. Professional TMCs should be able to highlight the return on investment to your business by partnering with theirs and look to not only reduce your overall supplier costs (air/hotel/car hire) but save your business is perhaps the most precious commodity of all, time.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/reduce-spend-supplier-management/,"Reduce spend with supplier management Organising business travel can be a time-consuming and costly affair. With flights to arrange, often at the last minute, as well as accommodation bookings and transport on the ground, how can companies of all sizes ensure they are getting the best return on investment in such a fast-paced and ever-changing industry? One of the most effective ways to reduce travel spend is to negotiate discounts with travel suppliers. Many businesses miss out on valuable savings because they don’t ask for a better deal, often assuming a supplier’s standard rate is the best available offer. While it is not always the case, how you ensure you are accessing the better deals? The benefits of managed travel That’s where a travel management company (TMC) with excellent supplier relations can make a huge difference to your bottom line. A good TMC provides established supplier relationships and industry expertise that simply aren’t available when you book directly with suppliers. Corporate Travel Management (CTM) is constantly finding ways to improve our customer’s travel spend across flights, hotel and ground transportation. Your Client Value Manager will analyse and review your business’s travel behaviour and spending patterns to get a comprehensive understanding of your specific requirements. We specialise in supplier management as it is often the key opportunity of spend control, we aren’t afraid to ask questions that ensure suppliers remain competitive, affordable and relevant to your business interests, not theirs. Based on this information, CTM can often negotiate significant discounts on preferred airlines and hotel chains while staying within the budget constraints of your travel policy. In the air The first thing that often comes to mind when coordinating business travel is the cost of flights. CTM has a suite of technologies, including our Fare Forecaster tool, that busy travellers and travel arrangers can access to ensure they have visibility of the best airfare prices available in advance of travel. Such tools highlight potential flight cost savings, providing comparisons across multiple airlines, time-frames, class of travel and loyalty benefits in a single search. Our experienced teams can also identify substantial cost savings that may be achieved through a preferred airline agreement, or through small changes to your booking behaviour. On the ground While reducing spend on flights is often a priority, significant savings can be achieved at ground level too. Having a strong connection to local hotel and car rental providers gives CTM the ability to negotiate the best possible rates, benefits and inclusions for customers, securing significant savings not available through independent bookings. In addition to delivering substantial savings from supplier negotiations to our customers, CTM’s strong global supplier relationships enable us to negotiate a broad range of valuable waivers and favours on behalf of our customers each year, which simply aren’t available when booking direct. Let us help you Negotiating the most cost-effective supplier agreements is just one way that CTM delivers unbeatable value to its customers. Our key goal is to help you get the most out of your corporate travel program, and we are constantly looking for ways to reduce expenditure, without compromising on safety, efficiency or quality. We are committed to developing highly customised travel management solutions that make a real difference to businesses of all sizes.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/corporate-traveller-well-being/,"Corporate traveller well-being  Travelling may be more complex in 2022, but it will likely be cleaner and safer than ever. The pandemic has changed the needs and necessities of how people travel, and the ability to incorporate key stakeholders such as human resources, risk management, legal, procurement and Travel Arrangers in travel policy evolution will be key to enabling a safe, confident and effective return to travel. As travel activities resume in the year ahead, corporate traveller well-being should be prioritised to ensure a healthy and seamless travel experience for all. CTM spoke with Dr Deb Mills, the Medical Director of theTravel Medicine Alliance– a network of expert travel medicine doctors – to unearth the key corporate traveller well-being considerations for both travellers and their employers in the year ahead. Well-being and jetlag “An individuals’ internal time clock (circadian rhythm), medical history, travel activities and how alert or creative they need to be during their travels is unique, so health routines and travel recovery times are equally unique to the individual” said Dr. Mills. The body can adjust naturally to 1 to 1.5 changes in time zones per day[3], but symptoms can arise when travelling long-haul (6+ hours), crossing five or more time zones in one day. “The more time zones an individual crosses in a short period, the higher the likelihood of severe jet lag symptoms. Business travellers may need to account for a couple of extra nights’ sleep at the destination, and upon return, to allow for sufficient body clock adjustment to support well-being and ensure they are performing to their best potential”, Dr. Mills explains. Last minute bookings According to Dr. Mills, booking travel at the last minute is a common and often avoidable booking behaviour which can have significant implications on corporate traveller well-being. A recent CTM booking trends analysis showed that the pandemic had influenced a 3-4% increase in last minute bookings (within 24 hours of departure) for domestic and international bookings during 2020 compared to pre-COVID travel activity in 2019. In the January to June 2021 period, advanced booking behaviours had begun returning towards pre-pandemic trends, a move which Dr. Mills says will support improved traveller health and well-being as business travellers increase their travel activity. “Don’t book last minute if it can be avoided. Travellers need time to mentally prepare for travel and coordinate their personal lives, especially in a more complex travel environment. Last minute bookings can present adverse health risks, and in some cases will be more costly due to limited availability”, said Dr. Mills. “The biggest concern I see as a medical professional would be people leaving at short notice and saying they don’t have sufficient time to prepare for their travel health. Most travel health preparations can be undertaken in advance, so that rapid deployment is safe when operationally required.”  Health assessments On occasion businesses may have a requirement to relocate staff overseas or interstate for projects or contract-based work. CTM asked Dr. Mills what health considerations and preparations are required prior to departure and on arrival. “Depending on the destination and duration of their trip, I recommend business travellers should have a formal travel health clearance assessment prior to departure so the company and the travel agent can document that their duty of care has been fulfilled. For relocations, this should include a complete medical examination as well as a vaccine and medication review. For short postings, a vaccine and medication review are usually sufficient”, explained Dr. Mills. Masks At the time of writing, wearing masks within airports and aircrafts in some countries is federally mandated to reduce the risk of infection. According to Dr. Mills “The use of ‘fashion masks’ – those that you might wear at home or in places where you can sufficiently social distance -are not best practice for travelling. The use of surgical masks for flying and in transit where social distancing is limited allows the traveller to more closely seal the mask to their face. “Some authorities recommend people change their mask every 4 hours – this isn’t always practical but should be changed daily at a minimum. More frequently is advisable during long-haul flights and could be timed to coincide with meals and refreshments. My personal tip to everyone is to always tear the loops when you dispose of masks to reduce the risk of harm to wildlife in situations where they may become tangled.” Hotel experiences When considering preferred suppliers for travel programs, focussing solely on the bottom line is no longer an adequate approach to procurement. In fact,CTM’s 2022 Business Travel Surveyshowed that the top priorities for travel programs in 2022 were traveller risk, safety and well-being, followed by cost savings and service. Dr. Mills added “Travelers need to feel safe, sleep well, eat nutritious food, have space and opportunity to exercise, and a good desk to work at with natural light. Escaping air-conditioning and opting for fresh air ventilation is now of importance, with many travellers seeking accommodation that provides windows that open or balconies. Contactless express check-outs or anything that limits touching surfaces are also other service solutions to consider for your travellers.” Traveller well-being extends past the implications of COVID-19 to areas such as travel policy compliance and risk management[4]. When business travellers and Travel Arrangers step outside the approved realms of their travel policy, it can have risk implications for both the traveller and the business. Involving travellers and Travel Arrangers in the process of risk management planning and procurement, and educating them on the importance of tracking, geolocation and compliance to approved suppliers will ensure they see value in the travel program and its broader role in travellers well-being.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/talking-sustainability/,"Talking sustainability with CTM’s Head of ESG & Sustainability There is an increased awareness across the global business community of climate change realities and the direct and indirect impacts of business practices on the environment. As such, organisations are increasing their commitment to sustainable business practices and how they can reduce their overall carbon footprint. Organisations are now paying greater attention to the factors that expose their business, employees and environment to risk and implementing strategic initiatives to support their values and corporate social responsibility. CTM’s 2022 Global Customer Survey, conducted in May, found that businesses and their travel program stakeholders are interested in learning more about sustainable travel, especially supply chain sustainability strategies (72%).  CTM sat down withCTM’s Head of ESG & Sustainabilityto learn more about his new appointment, and the role of the supply chain, supplier, customer and travel management companies in the quest to combat environmental, social and governance impacts. Can you describe the importance of your newly-created role in a post-pandemic environment? “As a service industry, CTM’s carbon footprint is relatively light, but we understand our role in taking action to mitigate climate change and embrace the opportunity we have to make a further positive impact on the planet by empowering our customers to make more informed and sustainable decisions around their travel activity and supply chain choices by putting the right technology and data in their hands. Our customers are showing an incredible appetite for travel again as well as an increasing demand to partner with a travel management company that can proactively address and support their social and environmental sustainability objectives. This is where I can add value to CTM’s focus on sustainable travel.” As Travel Managers review and refine their travel programs and policies, they have a unique opportunity to rethink their sustainability approach, create measurable goals and deliver impactful results. Would you agree? “Yes, absolutely. We expect the role of Travel Managers to become much more influential and strategic in delivering on business recovery and growth plans as travel activity increases under the more watchful eye of CFOs and CEOs. This is an exciting opportunity for Travel Managers to own a significant role in driving business performance through effective travel program development which supports all areas of business including sustainability objectives towards environmental social performance.”  Why is sustainable business travel becoming increasingly important to businesses? “Through global mandates and societal expectations, organisations globally are moving further towards a mature state of sustainability performance which includes how they are providing a value proposition to their stakeholders. Organisations are further increasing their awareness of how their business can benefit local communities through business travel initiatives. “It is widely acknowledged that business travel is a key enabler of business growth which supports employment and innovation and, as such, organisations are seeking new and improved ways to travel more sustainably to support their growth objectives and operational needs in line with their sustainability objectives and overall values.” What sustainability measures can businesses be taking in their travel programs? “Partnering with a travel management company (TMC) like CTM can support the needs of a customer to assist in the measurement and transparency of their performance goals such as enabling and validating the offset of their employee travel (Scope 3) GHG emissions.  Through our long-standing partnership with South Pole, and other great sustainability initiatives and partnerships such as our sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) agreement with Delta Airlines, CTM is well placed to assist and provide customers with the right choices to make when booking their travel needs. Further, we provide customers with a wellbeing measure to indicate their travellers’ potential fatigue levels based on the amount of travel, and we work with accommodation suppliers to support the safety and wellbeing of our customers’ solo travellers through our Social Sustainability Charter.”  How have you witnessed suppliers evolve their sustainable service offerings to accommodate the health, safety and wellbeing of travellers? “We have observed major hotel chains evolve their business offering to include improved performances towards sustainability. For example, hotels now apply efficiency standards for their guests regarding energy, waste and water management. We are seeing an expansion in their offering to ensure their guests feel safe and provide health and wellbeing offerings through bedding and menu selection choices. At CTM, we understand the importance of aligning our customers’ ESG goals with like-minded suppliers and work to secure preferred partnerships that can serve our customers’ needs.” How have you seen attitudes towards sustainability change since the pandemic? “From the onset of the recognised pandemic, the sustainability industry, in general, feared customers and businesses would relax on their push for sustainability performance due to a predicted shrinkage in the market. Since then, the industry has seen quite the opposite effect. It is observed that businesses have pushed on with their social and environmental sustainability plans, increasing their ambitions to drive greater reductions in their environmental and social sustainability impacts, including the consideration of the safety and wellbeing of their employees.” What trends are you seeing (or expect to see) in client RFPs concerning sustainability? “We have witnessed a great upsurge in sustainability maturity as societal expectations move sustainability performance beyond a ‘nice to have’ and towards ‘business as usual’. We are seeing positive drivers in sustainability emerge globally, such as the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) delivering a further proposal to mandate transparency and performance requirements for businesses globally. “For organisations, this will mean the industry will rely on travel management companies to assist them in identifying and delivering social and environmental sustainability impacts within the supply chain, to which CTM is well-placed to support its customers through our online booking tool – Lightning, our wellbeing measure, our carbon reporting in CTM Data Hub, and our carbon offset program.” When it comes to the decarbonisation of business travel, do you feel the industry is doing enough? “From my perspective, I believe the travel industry is generally consistent with other industries in addressing stakeholders’ sustainability expectations. Of course, as with all industries, there are some clear examples of companies leading the movement towards continuous improvement of performance delivery to customers. Certainly, I see CTM as one of those companies which attracted me to the Head of ESG and Sustainability role in the first instance. “At CTM, our team works to continuously improve our approach to sustainability by engaging with customers, employees and the industry to identify emerging trends and demand for new sustainability solutions. For example, the CTM Climate+ program enables customers to make a meaningful difference to the environment by making more informed travel decisions and understanding the impact of their travel program. We also continue to take a proactive approach to educating our customers on evolving sustainability news and initiatives across the travel supply chain, and in developing our relationships with suppliers who are leading the field in sustainable travel solutions.”  How can we improve supply chain readiness? “We simply must continually improve supply chain readiness, as it is important to our customers. CTM’s 2022 Global Customer Survey, found that 57% of respondents seek environmental sustainability features when selecting an airline, hotel or car rental provider. “To maximise sustainability performance in the industry, I see it as a great benefit for all stakeholders to continue driving proactive partnerships to identify and continually push the limits of opportunities that improve sustainability outcomes within the supply chain to deliver positive outcomes for stakeholders and the planet.”  As an intermediary, what do you believe CTM’s role is in building awareness and encouraging action? “CTM has a clear purpose for what it strives to deliver every day; that is to continue to deliver an enhanced value proposition to our customers and their corporate travellers. This is achieved through being an innovative and inspiring company of choice for our stakeholders, improving customer experience and enabling positive change for a better tomorrow. “When it comes to the success of our customers’ travel programs, we place the Travel Program Manager in the box seat. Our continuous feedback loops empower our customers to share ideas on how to improve our service and product offering. We enable our customers to demonstrate their strategic influence on their organisation’s sustainability initiatives by setting realistic CO2 emission targets for their business travel program. What does the future of sustainable corporate travel look like? Any predictions? What new partnerships and/or tools can we expect to see? “I believe organisations will continue to improve and validate their Scope 3 GHG emissions and improve their governance of the care and wellbeing of their employees. With further mandated improvements to sustainability reporting, there will be an increase in demand for reporting validations, to which CTM are already well-placed to support our customers’ needs. CTM works continuously with our industry partners to improve travel outcomes for our mutual customers. CTM continually strives to push the boundaries of innovative, market-leading tools and services which provide our clients with early access to solutions to maximise their ESG and sustainability performance.” Learn more about the CTM Group’s Sustainability Strategy here.

In today’s digital world, exacerbated by the recent lockdowns and worldwide pandemic, ‘offline’ booking methods seem even more obsolete and impractical. With a centralised, online travel booking process, businesses can increase their productivity and reduce costs significantly. Investing in travel technology such asOnline Booking Tools (OBTs)will be vital for companies looking to support the evolving needs of the business and travel workforce. Read on to find out how your company can benefit from investing in an OBT. 1. Save time and money It’s no surprise that online bookings incur muchlower booking feescompared to bookings made over the phone. When time equals money, utilising automated services is the best way to save dollars and improve productivity for your employees – why wait in the phone queue if you don’t have to! Booking domestic travel and simple itineraries online frees up your dedicated travel consultant to assist with the more complex travel itineraries, that’s when their expert knowledge really comes in handy. 2. Increase employee efficiency By eliminating the need for an in-house travel booker, OBTs allow your employees’ travel requests to be processed faster and reduce the workload pressure on PA’s and EA’s.Trainingis provided to ensure employees understand how to use the OBT’s features with ease, so that companies and their employees alike can experience the full benefit of their travel management solution.

All user information can be securely stored in the OBT through itsintuitive technology, reducing the risk of error when it comes to entering frequent flyer information or spelling a traveller’s name correctly 3. Ensure duty of care Knowing where your travellers are and how to contact them in times of an emergency has never been more front of mind.Traveller trackingandrisk alertsallow companies to easily locate and contact travellers in a timely manner should any travel safety risks arise.Pre-trip approvalfeatures prevent any risky or unconventional travel plans from being booked. Companies can assigndifferent levels of approvaland functionality to users, meaning responsibility is delegated appropriately and decision-makers are held accountable for their travellers. 4. Travel policy compliance Complete configuration of your company’stravel policyprevents users from booking travel that is not compliant. This can involve only displaying content from preferred suppliers or removing booking options that exceed price limits. If your company has negotiated rates with a supplier, you can upload those rates to the OBT and limit bookings to this provider only. 5. Improve data capture and reporting Access tobenchmarking data andtravel reportsprovides regular guidance and pro-active advice on how you can optimise your travel program. Advanced tools, such asPower BI,offer strategic account analysis to identify new savings opportunities and benchmark your contracts against similar companies – ensuring you get the best deal possible. 6. Book on-the-go As OBTs allow you to book last-minute flights or accommodation on the go, unexpected changes to your travel arrangements are no longer an issue. The ability to completeend-to-end bookings on yourmobile devicemeans that if you know you won’t be able to catch your connecting flight due to a late departure, you can book an alternative flight immediately, wherever you are. You can even book your connecting flight before you land with your carrier’s in-flight Wi-Fi service. 7. Sustainability Sustainability has become one of the primary concerns for businesses, causing many to set firm carbon-reduction targets across their operations. By providingvisibility over the carbon emissions for flights, hotels and car hire, OBTs allow you to evaluate the CO² emissions of each trip and better understand the environmental impact of your travel program. Through programs such as CTM’sClimate+,you can also offset the carbon footprint of your travel by supporting environmental sustainability initiatives.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/5-ways-to-leverage-business-travel-expense-data/,"5 ways to leverage business travel expense data  TheGlobal Business Travel Association(GBTA) predicts that global business travel spend will have made a full recovery by the end of 2024 totalling around $1.48 trillion. With some companies already back to 2019 business travel volumes and also navigating a new workforce landscape, it is time to reconsider how business travel expense is managed; identifying out-of-policy expenses and ensuring you can leverage that information to prevent exceptions in the future. Expense data can be useful to understand employee behaviour and why exceptions are occurring. It offers an opportunity to address those concerns and potentially alleviate traveller friction and/or increase policy compliance. Pre-ticketing information, available through CTM Data, allows you to monitor traveller bookings and capture policy exceptions before they occur. Analysing policy, exceptions and expense data can help you adjust program parameters to mitigate out-of-policy requests at the point of sale and address points of traveller friction that impede travellers’ productivity and job performance. Here are five ways Corporate Travel Management (CTM) can work with your business to leverage business travel expense data to drive travel policy development and program initiatives: 1. Capturing the right data When was the last time you checked your enhanced data fields? Is your business capturing the right information to assist in your reconciliation processes? CTM can support with identifying and capturing the right booking information for your expense management tool to help streamline your reconciliation process, saving time and creating efficiencies across your business for the traveller and your financial team. 2. Hybrid workforces will call for a greater need for travel and expense control With more employees working remotely or in a hybrid environment, CTM can help businesses to start thinking about the functionality of travel and expense management by setting up a travel policy for remote employees and having the right controls in place to automatically track expenses to prevent out of policy spend before it happens. 3. Align policy with user groups and reward road warriors Are certain groups of travellers consistently expensing travel reservations that are out of policy for a due cause? We tailor policy levels to multiple user groups while also considering individual preferences. This allows you to set out-of-policy exceptions and alerts for general user groups, while still catering to your elite travellers, top producers, and executives. 4. Mitigate direct buying and leakage We help our clients establish adoption campaigns, design supplier promotions, identify program ambassadors, and engage reluctant users directly. CTM can help you communicate with travellers through traditional and non-traditional channels directed at driving traveller choice and behaviour. We apply policy and tailored messaging to our booking tools, mobile applications, gamification tools, scripting, direct traveller and agent communications and more. We can also bundle the flight, car hire and accommodation into a singular booking, with no additional costs. This enhances corporate duty of care by ensuring traveller movements can be monitored easily and effectively through one booking. 5. Providing technology to make informed decisions In addition to our personalised service, CTM gives you the tools needed to quickly and efficiently identify possible cost savings in the purchasing and booking process, through predictiveforecasting, behaviour and trend analysis and industry benchmarking. Furthermore, access to frequently updated pre-ticketing data allows you to capture and respond to policy breaches and reduce spend through improved policy compliance. This is all supported through a single, global reporting hub. Is your TMC helping you leverage your business travel expense data into an actionable travel program strategy? If you are not leveraging your expense data into going forward travel policy strategies, you may risk advancing overall program goals, continued leakage, poor program visibility and increased cost.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/creating-an-effective-travel-policy/,"Creating an effective travel policy  Effective business travel programs are built on well-crafted travel policies. Creating a travel policy that is clear, simple, and easily accessible will go a long way to encouraging employee adoption post-pandemic. Travel policies should be reviewed each time there is a change in market conditions. The pandemic has left no stone unturned which means Travel Managers will need to work with key stakeholders to execute necessary changes to support renewed business goals. A relevant and up to date travel policy will form the framework for a successful travel program, assisting businesses to achieve short and long-term goals. Mike Orchard, Principal Consultant atFestive Road, an independent travel consultancy that supports companies with their travel RFP process to drive travel program excellence, suggests one of the most significant shifts occurring in travel program priorities since the pandemic is the focus on ‘purposeful travel’. “We are calling on companies to stop thinking about travel volume as a per cent of 2019 volume. That’s like doing a drag and drop of 2019 practices into a new era, it’s an outdated practice that won’t help any company succeed into the future. Instead, we’ve developed a ‘Purposeful Travel Model’ which enables a smarter conversation that focuses on where being there in-person will expedite or improve the outcome.” CTM’s 2022 Business Travel Survey found the top priority for business travel programs in 2022 was traveller risk, safety and well-being followed jointly by cost reduction and service.  According to Orchard, the pause in travel volumes alongside changes to the way organisations operate have provided a unique opportunity for Travel Managers to assess the value of business travel – ensuring it is seen as a strategic enabler to their company, not a budget line item. “The opportunity for Travel Managers is to lead their company’s business travel strategies in consultation with their senior stakeholders. Travel Managers are now moving from “how” to safely reopen travel to “why” certain types of business travel should restart. This gives the Travel Manager the chance to position business travel, and their own roles, as key strategic enablers within their organisation.” The overhaul of long-form travel RFPs A shift in priorities is not the only significant change facing Travel Managers. According to Orchard, the process of conducting a travel RFP has also experienced a major overhaul in response to the pandemic. “57% of Travel Managers told us recently that they don’t believe the traditional ‘long-form’ travel RFP works anymore. Instead, what we’ve found is that Travel Managers are looking to streamline the RFP process and be more strategic about asking the right questions at the right time. “The perfect client and TMC partnershipare found through the 3Cs – finding the right match between the client and the travel management company’s culture, capabilities and commercials that are finely attuned to the client’s needs. Post-pandemic business travel is being enhanced by a much stronger focus onsustainability, traveller well-being, and diversity, equity and inclusion. The key is for the industry to evolve the debate from concept to reality. These are areas where TMCs have fantastic opportunities to consult with and educate clients on practical and pragmatic strategies to help enhance their programs.” When asked what future trends are expected to steer travel recovery, Orchard believes balancing the ‘fear of missing out’ with strategic budget and performance management will be key. “Now, the fear of missing out will drive much stronger growth in travel, but with a new focus on the trips that add most value. We are seeing a shift from the old way of thinking where travel was seen as a P&L line, to a new way of thinking where travel is seen as an investment.” Speak to a travel expert today to discuss guidelines around creating a travel policy.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/future-of-digital-health-passports/,"The future of digital health passports  Interoperable digital health passports will have a larger role to play in enabling overseasbusiness travelat scale, by ensuring travellers meet minimum vaccination and/or health status and reducing or eliminating the need for quarantine where required on arrival. Recent Deloitte research[1]shows the easing of entry restrictions was among respondents’ top four triggers for increased travel, which means understanding the future of digital health passports will be key to post-pandemic travel. The International Air Transport Association(IATA) is the trade association for the world’s airlines, representing 83% of total air traffic. During 2021, IATA launched theIATA Travel Passwhich is a digital health passport app currently being tested by 70 airlines and arming travellers with information on test requirements, where they can get tested / vaccinated and how they can share results and certificates with airlines and border authorities in a secure manner. CTM interviewed Vinoop Goel, Regional Director, Airports and External Relations, Asia Pacific to learn more about the future landscape of digital health passports. Goel explains “The IATA Travel Pass is a critical tool for the restart of international travel. We don’t see the IATA Travel Pass as being the only solution for managing travel health credentials. We believe there should be a competitive market for solutions and our aim is for airlines and their passengers to have a choice. What’s more important is that governments adopt and recognize a standard for digital health credentials – documentation of vaccination or testing status – that can be used across various tools.” What would differentiate the IATA Travel Pass from its market competitors? “It leverages IATA’s Timatic solution to ensure a passenger’s health status meets the requirements of the destination country. This enables passengers to be assured that they are good to go and airlines to simplify their check-in process without having to go through the details of the passenger’s health documents”, says Goel. “The IATA Travel Pass app has been designed by the industry for the industry, with input from an advisory group composed of 19 airlines representing all regions of the world to ensure that it meets the needs of the industry. We worked with over 70 airlines around the world on trials of the IATA Travel Pass. This allowed us to identify and resolve teething issues.”  Teething issues aside, the traveller experience looks different from pre-pandemic days with the check-in process being lengthier. Goel suggests “The reality is that when traffic returns to pre-COVID-19 levels, passengers could spend up to 8 hours in airport processes if the current paper-based methods for verifying health credentials are to continue. That is not sustainable. Today’s airports are not built to have all passengers turn up at the airport to check in for their flights. With the IATA Travel Pass, we hope to be able to resume the off-airport check-in options, such as mobile or online check-in. “It enables passengers to create a digital version of their passport on their phone. The passenger can then choose to securely send their passport details to airlines, airports and border control. This will ensure that documents and identity verification can be performed off-airport, and facial recognition can be used to swiftly process passengers at key touch points at the airport without the need to physically exchange passports and boarding passes.” According to the results of IATA’s most recent traveller survey, conducted in September 2021 across 11 markets, 88% of respondents supported the use of digital health passports to manage health credentials. But what about data privacy? A concern for business travellers is how their information is stored and shared. “For the IATA Travel Pass, travellers will remain in control of their data, ensuring it is protected and only shared with airlines and governments at the approval of the traveller” explains Goel. IATA TRAVEL PASS user journey If test results and related vaccination certificate meet destination’s health requirements, the app will show OK to Travel status. YOU’RE READY FOR TAKE OFF!

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/2022-business-travel-landscape/,"2022 Business Travel Landscape The Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) shares expert insights on navigating the business travel landscape in 2022. TOP TAKE-AWAYS: Vaccination roll outs, re-opening of offices and easing of quarantine requirements have presented an opportunity for businesses to re-engage face-to-face. For select industries, travel never stopped. However for some, 2022 will see the resumption of ‘normal’ travel activity after a significant pause in connectivity. What to expect: Understanding the new and evolving travel landscape will be pivotal to making informed decisions to best support your business goals for 2022 and beyond. Engaging with key stakeholders to navigate the changes to approval processes, suppliers, public health, technology, duty of care and sustainability will be just some of the topics for debate. According to a 2021 Deloitte corporate travel survey[1], 2022 will be the start of a fresh view to business travel, with COVID-19 no longer the primary focus and concern for businesses. The notion of executive approval to embark on a domestic journey will become a thing of the past. The Global Business Travel Association (GBTA), the world’s largest professional association representing the global travel industry, connects business travel professionals from every continent with the knowledge, research and advocacy needed to navigate the rapidly changing business travel landscape. They’ve been busy during the pandemic providing virtual education sessions with Travel Buyers and suppliers to provide important educational updates across the travel sector. Following the release of their latestglobal business travel COVID-19 recovery poll, CTM interviewed GBTA CEO Suzanne Neufang to discuss the major challenges currently facing the global business travel community. “The travel industry’s response to the pandemic saw suppliers step up to the plate, wholly committed to serving their customers and the public. They operated as test result and vaccination-status gatekeepers where required, providing new services and tools to figure out the state of ‘normal’ at the time. And every brand helped their frontline workers to enable essential travel to continue. This level of adaptability and resilience certainly did not surprise me coming from an industry that is well attuned to change”, said Neufang. GBTA’s COVID-19 recovery poll, conducted in mid-October 2021, revealed an increasingly optimistic outlook and readiness to travel: “There’s the question of business traveller readiness – dipping a toe in the travel pond is more worrying for some employees than for others. There’s also the question of changing local requirements – are the rules at the destination the same as the city or state, province or region that the traveller came from? Education and access to information still remains key to providing maximum confidence and duty of care”, said Neufang. CTM’s 2022 Business Travel Survey, conducted in November 2021, showed more than half of respondents had taken a flight since July 2021. Traveller confidence was higher than expected, with 87% of respondents feeling somewhat to very confident (3-5/5) travelling domestically, and 60% feeling somewhat to very confident (3-5/5) travelling internationally.  Neufang also added that one of the key considerations is whether there’s an available place to meet for business on the other side of that plane, train, or automobile journey. Cushman & Wakefield’s[2]recent research suggests that by Q2 2022, 70% of the globe will be vaccinated and current trends suggest most office workers globally will be able to return to the office in Q1 2022. Currently, office building occupancy sits at 40% and it is forecasted that by early 2022 cities and office buildings will be invigorated with employees returning to work. When asked what gaps remain in business travel services and solutions to enable a return to pre-pandemic travel activity, Neufang identified two key areas of focus for the year ahead. “There continues to be a major opportunity for pandemic-related duty of care offerings – from white-glove consultancy expertise to moretechnology-based apps. And access to COVID-19 test kits needs to be more widely available and affordable all over the world so these can become part of a daily health regimen for any business traveller before, during and after their trip.” Eager to find out more about the 2022 business travel landscape?

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/what-is-unmanaged-business-travel-costing-my-company/,"What is unmanaged business travel costing my company?  The true cost of business travel can be hard to quantify. Unlike set costs, such as payroll and other regular operating expenses, various direct and indirect factors contribute to the real cost of travel for your business. Finding the time to book, supplier rates and access to technology can all impact your bottom line. Similarly, businesses both large and small can feel the effects of unmanaged business travel, with out-of-policy travel often being the main contributor to increased spending. That’s why at CTM we offer a full analysis of your business’s travel costs to arm you with the information to make an informed decision if your travel program is providing the best value and is fully optimised for cost avoidance. In this blog, we list some areas for consideration when reviewing your business travel. Booking business travel is not always straightforward. How many hours per week are you paying staff to book travel? Booking travel is not always straightforward. There is the initial search for price and availability, the consideration of alternative travel days and then a price comparison between multiple suppliers before an itinerary is finalised. Industry knowledge also tells us that most ‘Travel Bookers’ are usually employed for other administrative tasks; taking time away from other important duties and hindering their efficiency. Therefore, an important indirect cost of booking to review is – employee cost per hour. Introducing a travel management company (TMC) and an online booking tool such asLightningcould reduce your employee’s booking time from over half an hour to less than ninety seconds, significantly reducing the booking cost. OurSMART Calculatoruses information collected through our industry experts to provide you with a guide to how much you could be saving with a managed business travel program.  How can you be sure you are getting the best value? An unmanaged business travel policy will mean time spent booking on consumer websites or direct resulting in your business not always receiving the best corporate rates and value ads. Working with a TMC, such as CTM, allows you to take advantage of their global buying power as well as specially negotiated rates that are unavailable to the general public, such as theCTM Preferred Hotel Program. A TMC can also assist you in direct negotiations with suppliers and will ensure your agreed rates and discounts are applied to each of your bookings. A travel policy that requires employees to book travel through a TMC ensures there are no missed opportunities. For every dollar your business invests in a TMC-managed travel program, you will see a positive return in cost savings through negotiated supplier rates and enforceable policy controls. If you’re paying more to book and manage your travel than you’re saving it might be time to talk to an experienced TMC.  Travel technology can save you dollars The efficiency of processing bookings and a holistic overview of the company’s travel expense data can be very time-consuming and cumbersome for unmanaged business travel programs. Intuitive travel technology tools that create a positive end-user experience for your travellers and bookers are an important consideration when it comes to developing a budget-friendly travel policy. Without an internal approval system, businesses that allow staff to book business travel directly can find they are subject to a significant degree of out-of-policy booking costs. Technology and user-friendly online booking tools, such asLightningandCTM Mobile, offering 24/7 accessibility, inbuilt booking and policy controls andapproval systems, can save your business thousands of dollars per year. Do you have easy access to your travel program’s expense data? If you are not leveraging this information into travel policy strategies you may risk advancing overall program goals, continued leakage, poor program visibility and increased cost. Furthermore, access to frequently updated pre-ticketing data allows you to capture and respond to policy breaches before they happen, helping to reduce spending and improving policy compliance. Data Analysis tools such asCTM SMART Dataprovide all of this along with an easy-to-digest visual representation of your corporate travel program’s performance. You can access your business’s travel data online at any time, with a wide variety of search options available.Forecasting, benchmarking and hypothetical data inputs also allow you to see how changes to your travel program could optimise costs and savings in the future. A TMC will help drive savings A good TMC can help your business streamline processes and develop a travel policy that drives savings through greater buying power, leading technology solutions and access to expert support teams and Account Management. Professional TMCs will be able to highlight the return on investment by partnering with them and look to not only reduce your overall supplier costs but save your business time.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/travel-risk-assessment/,"Business Travel Risk Assessment Best Practices  Top take-aways: The pandemic influenced a significant shift in travel program focus toward traveller safety, health and well-being. As domestic and international travel continues to increase and return to pre-pandemic levels, businesses will still need to remain informed as the travel landscape evolves. Having the right plan, strategies, and systems and being armed with up-to-date information will be key to safeguarding travellers and the business. The Business Continuity Institute[5]published an article in April 2021 that outlined valuable lessons learned from the pandemic which could be considered when reviewing travel risk policy and procedures. It suggests: Risklineis a travel risk intelligence organisation that provides real-time risk insights for destinations around the world. They monitor breaking developments from local sources including government travel advisories and bulletins from law enforcement, emergency services, security forces, and disaster relief agencies as well as social media sources. CTM interviewed Riskline’s founder and CEO, Kennet Nordlien to unearth the importance of risk assessment and communication tools for business travel. Nordlien expects the varying health, vaccination and testing requirements will remain in place for the foreseeable future in some regions, and businesses need to prepare their travel programs to integrate these requirements into theirrisk managementprocesses and solutions. Riskline’s layer of COVID-19 risk intelligence, integrated alongside its traditional risk management insights, required the company to increase its global analytical team by approximately 20% during the pandemic. “We have over a decade of experience in real-time crisis tracking, which meant that we were quickly able to adapt to the outbreak of the pandemic, to counter the ‘infodemic’ that it created and the fast- changing regulatory environment that came with government responses. “Some of the travel measures that were enacted, such as passenger locator forms, digitised health documents and COVID-passes, will almost certainly remain in place for some time to come in some parts of the world, especially for international travel. Let’s not forget that COVID-19 wasn’t the first pandemic the world has seen and is unlikely to be the last. Because of this, our COVID-19 travel intelligence will continue to remain important to those who want to stay safe and informed on their travels.” A risk assessment had become a core component of pre-trip approval workflows for most businesses even pre-COVID, and presents a significant increase in demand now businesses have resumed travel.   “COVID-19 was everyone’s duty of care wake-up call. At many companies, a risk assessment is now mandatory before a trip is approved, even at a domestic level. During the pandemic, governments made last-minute legislative changes regarding lockdown rules and travel restrictions, which meant that it became vital for Travel Managers, Travel Arrangers and travellers to have access to emergency two-way communications tools.” And what’s next for risk management solutions beyond the COVID-19 response era? Nordlien predicts: “Riskline is always working towards improving and evolving our products to meet changes in the travel industry. In preparation for increased levels of travel, we have several product updates in the pipeline, such as improvements to our Alert Messaging capabilities and mapping systems. Last year our AI sourcing tool added COVID-19 related items to their results feed, allowing our analytical team to be alerted to travel restriction changes more quickly.” [5]The BCI – Travel risk management: Why it’s important, 8 April, 2021.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/business-travel-with-purpose-can-you-afford-not-to-go/,"Business travel with purpose: Can you afford not to go? After a two-year pause, the world has reopened to business travel. In fact, business travel recovery is predicted to experience 38% year-over-year growth in 2022 to USD$1 trillion, and exceed pre-pandemic 2019 spend levels (USD$1.4 trillion) by 2024, a year earlier than previously forecast according to theGlobal Business Travel Association’s (GBTA) 2021 Business Travel Index (BTI). Further, of the 400 global business travellers polled in GBTA’s BTI research,86% reported that they need travel to accomplish their business goals, and 81% believe that their volume of domestic business travel will be greater or on par in 2022 than it was before the pandemic. For most businesses, the return to business travel is no longer a matter of ‘if’ or ‘when’, but ‘why’. As such, companies are more focused than ever before on understanding the return on investment of their travel spend. According to GBTA’s research, Chief Financial Officers (CFO) felt the top return-on-investment reasons for business travel in 2022 would be: This makes sense given the proven impact of face-to-face connectivity to winning and retaining business. According to theHarvard Business Review,face-to-face communication is up to 34 times more powerful than online communication. This is further supported by a study conducted byForbeswhere 95% of respondents said face-to-face meetings are essential for long term business relationships. People prefer in-person meetings because they:  Corporate Travel Management(CTM)’s2021 Business Travel Surveyasked what business travellers were most looking forward to achieving from the purpose of their business travel in 2022.Beyond sales and customer retention motivations, respondents listed engaging with partners and suppliers and driving innovation and knowledge sharing within their top 5 objectives, demonstrating a shift to a more purposeful outlook for business travel programs. When we need to reach an agreement, collaborate, and ensure a mutual understanding between people, the function of face-to-face meetings is an unrivalled solution for many. Designing a travel program that can demonstrate its value as an enabler to your business strategy instead of a budget line item will not only give your business a competitive edge in sales and customer retention but also provide opportunities for further savings (and improved ROI) through increased employee engagement, development and retention while supporting ideation and innovation. Business travel for sales and customer retention Retaining customers is considered to be at least five times more cost-effective than finding new ones, which is why retention of customers is critical to business performance. According to aHarvard Business Review, an increase of 5% in customer retention can lead to 25%-95% higher profits. Investing time and money into in-person meetings highlight the importance of the business relationship. If you’re not connecting face-to-face with your customers but a competitor is, the risk of losing your customer could far outweigh the cost of your trip. Mary Ellen Hess, CTM’s Executive Vice President Business Development – North America, knows first-hand the importance and value of in-person meetings and says “Procuring travel services involves building relationships, rapport and trust. At CTM we’ve been fortunate to experience significant growth during the pandemic and the key to this has been the continuation of meeting in-person where possible. Personalised service is a core value at CTM and there’s just nothing like face-to-face communication to demonstrate loyalty and trust.” A travel management company (TMC) can also support organisations in their analysis of the value of their business travel expenditure, as it aligns to your business’s goals and performance data, by capturing the ‘reason for travel’ at the point of booking. A shift in ‘reason for travel’ aligned to a rise or fall in business performance (for example sales, customer retention, employee churn) may be a valuable indicator to reviewing your travel program, budget or approval processes. The data [1] below represents a CTM customer’s travel activity by reason code pre and post-pandemic. Pre-pandemic (2019), the customer’s top 3 reasons for travelling include: In contrast, the customer’s post-pandemic travel data presents some interesting shifts in the reasons for travel, including: CTM’s Managing Director Jamie Pherousacknowledges the value of CTM’s own travel activity as the driver of record new business wins during the first half of FY22.

We have won significant new client accounts because we are prepared to get on a plane and meet face-to-face, showing our investment in building relationships and going the extra mile for our customers. We’ve been able to effectively resolve supply chain constraints due to face-to-face engagement, which has been a great benefit to our business and customers and could not have been possible without travelling.” In a recent interview with Business Travel News, Pherous spoke about the impact on businesses operating in countries with closed or restricted borders. “If you’re closed out, you’re going to miss winning market share or you’re going to lose customers. And as we all know, supply chain issues right now are a big, global problem. Those that can get on planes and see their supplier and sort it out get in front of the queue of the others that can’t. There’s a real cost now to those that don’t open up when the rest of the global economy has opened.” Pherous also explains “Our teams have been able to fast-track some complex projects by getting together in a room, achieving tangible outcomes in a matter of hours instead of weeks or months. On a recent business trip to North America, we were able to achieve resolutions within four days of meeting in-person that would have taken months to resolve via virtual means. The benefits of collaboration and problem solving as a team together in one room are undeniable.”  Business travel for employee engagement, development and retention According to theWork Institute, it costs as much as 33% of a workers’ annual salary to replace them, and in a highly competitive recruitment market, those costs can be even higher. CTM’s 2021 Business Travel Surveyfound that training and developing employees, engaging and retaining employees, and recruiting new employees were within the top 10 motivations for business travel in 2022. Additionally, the top three types of business events that business travellers expect to attend in 2022 include internal meetings (64%), conferences (59%) and team-building and training (41%). Well before the pandemic, organisations have been challenging traditional approaches to thetraining and developmentof employees. Whilst previously there was a desire for more digital learning – for the benefits of accessibility, efficiency and customisation – the perceived benefits of digital and remote learning have not necessarily played out with some competencies best taught and learned in-person. Layering remote learning with extended periods of remote working has left many employees feeling disconnected and disengaged from their employer and colleagues. CTM’s events division, Event Travel Management (ETM), specialises in delivering strategic business events, conferences, incentives and team-building experiences for a wide range of corporate businesses.ETM’s Global Strategic Lead, Tracey Edwardssays “We’ve received an increase in events enquiries where customers want to get their team members together for face-to-face events to provide a focus on company culture and to recognise and reward their staff where they haven’t been able to over the past 18 months.” ETM’s customers have acknowledged the importance of knowledge sharing, relationships and engagement with employees and the benefits this brings to their business.Marcy Holdsworth; Manager, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health at James Cook Universitysays “The work we do in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health is all about relationship building which made it easy to decide on a face-to-face delivery as opposed to going virtual for the 2021 program. It is important to note, if COVID-19 had prevented us from face to face delivery then we would have pivoted to virtual. However, there is no substitute for in-person connection which allows for networking, collegiality, building rapport, and stakeholder engagement.” According to an article byForbes, those organisations looking to develop employees’ interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence and the ability to engage and influence others are not as able to do so in an online environment. Ultimately the desire to learn and grow is fundamental to human nature, so investing in training and development opportunities can be an effective strategy for increasing employee satisfaction. Determining a return on investment (ROI) from the purpose of business travel will be unique to each company and industry depending on the role of the traveller, the intended outcome of the trip and the business’s unique growth goals and objectives – which may have shifted significantly in response to the pandemic. For some businesses, the travel budget may be driven by sales and customer retention goals. For others, travelling for employee recruitment and development might be the priority. While digital communications are here to stay, their valuable contribution to achieving strategic growth goals is becoming better understood. With travel restrictions easing, the travel industry is witnessing a resurgence in business travel activity, with pent-up demand for in-person connectivity being evident in bustling airports, increased airline routes and schedules, and travel activity surpassing early predictions. Ensure your travel management company can track and report on your travel spend and reasons for travel to help evaluate the ROI of your travel investment by the purpose of business travel and its contribution to your business’s overall performance.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/navigating-business-travel-for-hybrid-and-remote-workforces/,"Navigating business travel for hybrid and remote workforces Hybrid or remote workforces have increasingly become a part of the modern working era and as such may require changes to business travel policies and programs; including investing in technology, securing meeting spaces, and reviewing processes and travel policies to accommodate the change in traditional business travel patterns and meetings behaviour. According to a range of recent studies, over the last decade, the number of people who work from home has risen by159%.  The majority of employers (83%) say they plan to put more flexible work policies in place, such as allowing more people to work from home or letting them adjust their schedules. A further62%of employees aged 22-55 claim to already work remotely at least occasionally, and16%of organisations globally are already fully remote.  Where the global pandemic may have spurred the evolving 9-5 office structure, some of the reasons have been the advancement in technology, allowing people to work from anywhere in the world, and also the personal desire for flexibility and improved work-life balance. Further to this,over a third of businessesare also looking to expand internationally, and the majority say that they have chosen remote working because it accelerates speed to market in new countries. CBREsuggests“The office’s new purpose will be to provide a venue for community, culture and collaboration. Employees will be spending less time on individual/focused tasks while on-site and more time collaborating, networking and socialising.” A remote or hybrid workforce drives business travel change With employees working from various locations, it is only natural that organisations may experience a change to their traditional business travel patterns, in particular travel that was historically classified under ‘internal meetings’ travel. AnOxford Economics surveydemonstrates that business travellers who work remotely all or some of the time reported that their employers encourage them to travel. The reasons for travel are to:  Historical key travel days of the week may also change along with the duration of business trips. Remote or hybrid employees may travel less frequently than traditional in-office business travellers, however, they may be more likely to increase their length of stay to meet with more customers, colleagues, business partners or supply chain per trip, providing a greater return on investment to their employer’s travel budget. Those who work remotely, more so than hybrid employees, may also look to extend stays with a leisure component increasing the frequency of ‘bleisure’ travel – the combination of both business and leisure travel. How these travel components are tracked and accounted for will require a review of travel policies and visibility of travel data and spending. Business travel for in-person connection The future of flexible working arrangements will still necessitate continued business travel to support organisational growth goals through business development and customer retention. Collaboration technology certainly has its place, however there is no substitute for in-person engagement and if organisations are not in front of their customers their competition is likely to be. According to CTM’s 2022 Global Customer Survey,80% of respondents expect to travel more or the same amount in the coming 12 months as they did pre-pandemic, and59% expect to do more in-person meetings in the coming 12 monthscompared to current activity. Upholding the work culture across distributed teams will be important for employee retention and continued professional development. Whether employees travel to the organisation’s head office or offsite locations, it will be important for the opportunity to network, collaborate and build rapport with one another. Marla Everett,Director, Consulting Solutions for Event Travel Management (ETM) explains“The meetings and events industry was originally forecasted to bounce back behind leisure and corporate, but in fact, it has been quite the opposite. In North America, ETM’s 2022 transactions already exceed that of 2019. A large part of this can be attributed to a strong desire for in-person connection resulting from businesses moving to a remote or hybrid workforce and also the challenges presented to retaining and obtaining employees.”  Corporate travel technology - improving the user experience Organisations may find they will need to take a holistic approach to corporate travel management, moving away from focusing on the bottom line to a focus onemployee wellbeing. With more employees and business travellers spreading their time between home, travel and the office, organisations will need future-focused technology and flexible travel policies to streamline the booking process providing a better user experience for both the traveller and travel booker. Having up-to-date travel content, risk management tools, mobile technology, travel forecasting and pre-trip approval tools will provide a more positive business travel experience for all employees in any given destination. Pre-trip approval Managing manual travel requests may no longer be a long-term solution. Developing a pre-trip approval process with the guidance of your travel management partner will help simplify decision-making when managing the business travel for a hybrid workforce. Integrating approval processes will be important for organisations to manage a steady stream of travel requests. Pre-trip approval will also assist in eliminating any missed ticketing deadlines which can add to the bottom line. CTM Approveis a highly customisable pre-trip approval solution that provides organisations with an end-to-end approval workflow, streamlines processes and drives travel program compliance, whilst mitigating traveller risk and minimising lost savings. Travel and expense management More than ever before, expense management will be vital for the visibility of travel spending enabling organisations to optimise their travel program and identify cost savings. Paper-based expense and invoice management may lead to challenges in a remote work setting, creating an unnecessary burden on staff members and opening up the potential for errors. The use of integrated expense management solutions can help control spending and allow Finance Managers to approve expenses and automatically update them into finance management systems without needing a hard copy paper trail. Outlining a clear travel and expense policy will ensure business travellers follow best practices and having an integrated expense management tool will help business travellers efficiently process expenses for greater efficiency and complete travel spend visibility. Expense datacan be useful to understand employee behaviour and why exceptions are occurring. It offers an opportunity to address those concerns and potentially alleviate traveller friction and increase policy compliance. Pre-ticketing information, available throughCTM’s Data Hub, allows you to monitor traveller bookings and identify policy exceptions. Travel risk management Knowing where employees are is critical to supporting their health and safety. In a hybrid or remote environment, organisations will need to consider: Having access to real-time risk management tools will assist organisations to identify risks, track and communicate with their travellers no matter where they are. GTN conducted abusiness travel surveyof a range of industries, office locations and remote work/business travel population sizes. Of the72% of organisations that reported having a global travel policy in place, only 31% were utilising a method to track their business travel population. CTM’s risk managementsolutions are designed to help organisations meet their duty of care obligations while providing business travellers with the confidence they need to make business travel safer, more productive and enjoyable. From traveller tracking tools to SMS risk notifications, pre-trip risk assessments and mobile booking technology, CTM can tailor a risk management solution to meet an organisation’s business objectives. Technology is changing work culture in ways that will make business travel more important to a remote or hybrid workforce seeking to connect. For those organisations who have adopted a flexible work environment, it will be important to understand the travel behaviour and travel pattern changes, the risks associated with employee locations and also how travel policies, programs and technology can assist to manage those risks to save the organisation unnecessary costs. Working with a trusted travel management partner to help understand and manage the complexity of this new era of business travel will be key to maximising value, safety and strategic outcomes from your business travel program.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/corporate-hotel-programs-how-to-measure-value/,"Corporate Hotel Programs: How to measure value?  Accommodation is a key part of our customers’ travel spending and Corporate Travel Management (CTM) has the technology and expertise to help them accurately identify savings opportunities. At CTM, we invest heavily in delivering tools and services which maximise savings, including rate forecasting technology, access to pre-paid last-minute inventory and tactical supplier negotiations. Our Account Management team also work closely with our customers to understand what service offerings they consider valuable to their business and employees as this can vary greatly. What is value? Businesses should understand what they deem valuable. This does not always solely come down to achieving the lowest possible rate available at the risk of the standard of hotel, level of service, location, amenities or value adds. Considering the wellbeing of travellers may also be valuable to ensure they are well-rested, enabling them to carry out the intended purpose of travel most effectively and productively, often delivering greater returns.  Consolidating all hotel spending, whether it be transient, groups, projects, long stay or hybrid travel, will help to increase buying power. Some organisations are using this buying power not to achieve cost savings, but to increase the quality of hotel selection for a better traveller experience. Corporates are focused on taking the friction out of travel to make it an enjoyable experience and a positive component of the employee value proposition, which is critical to the retention of employees. The consideration of location is also important. This can be the proximity of hotels to regional offices, project sites, customers’ offices, or conference and event venues. The ability for business travellers to walk eliminates incidental expenditure of ride-share, taxis or private transfers, providing cost savings back to the business and reducing their carbon footprint. Hotels have also evolved in recent years with many new brands and service offerings coming to market which means deciding on what ‘type’ of hotel solutions are required to service the travellers’ needs. Full-service, self-catering, chain or independent boutique hotels all have different service offerings; each valuable but not necessarily suitable for every business or traveller. Length of stay can also be considered when measuring value. Placing a traveller in a full-service hotel for an extended stay may be better suited to an apartment-style solution where they have the home comforts of a kitchen, washing facilities and more space to work around a busy schedule. Value may also be found in preferred hotels that are selected based on a long-term like-minded partnership where they are working towards achieving common goals such as sustainability.  According to the2022 CTM Global Customer Survey, 57% of respondents said they seek environmental sustainability features and or services when selecting a hoteland as such will be important to future hotel negotiations to support business objectives.  Where the duty of care is paramount, consideration of hotel security features including 24-hour reception and dedicated floor swipe access may be incorporated as a mandatory requirement. Enhanced commitment and policies to cleaning with certified programs may also be valuable to negotiations. Employee feedback forms, surveys or word of mouth are a great way to understand the performance of your current suppliers’ value and suitability for their intended purpose. CTM Global Hotel Program With a preferred hotel program,CTMcustomers have access to special rates, benefits and inclusions that have been negotiated with your preferred accommodation partners. Customers can also access theCTM Global Hotel Programwhich provides access to exclusively negotiated corporate room rates and a wide range of value-added experiences at more than 45,000 properties in over 170 countries around the globe. Having a strong connection to local hotel providers across global markets gives CTM the ability to negotiate the best possible rate for our customers, securing significant savings that are not available through independent bookings.  Driving hotel compliance via CTM technology The intuitive and user-friendly interface of CTM’s online booking tool Lightning, helps drive adoption and policy compliance, in turn reducing leakage for more enhanced supplier negotiations. Lightning also has a hotel policy listing option which only allows hotels that meet in-policy requirements to be displayed in search results, minimising out-of-policy bookings. Using insights for benefits Understanding the full picture of our customers’ travel profiles and preferences is the key to identifying savings opportunities. This includes how many nights they are booking, when and where those bookings are taking place and any incidental expenditure. Having the right level of expertise and experience in negotiating with hotel suppliers is paramount for achieving the best possible savings for customers. This includes understanding the ideal time of year to launch requests for proposals for accommodation suppliers to capitalise on market over-supply. CTM’s Account Managers and Supplier Relations team have extensive experience and influential supplier partnerships, and work with our customers to develop corporate hotel programs that will maximise savings while delivering value to their business.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/balancing-travel-policy-compliance-with-the-traveller-experience/,"Balancing travel policy compliance with the traveller experience  The modern-day business traveller is evolving. Their expectations are changing as a result of remote working and world events. What was valued in previous years may not be a business traveller’s priority this year or next. According to a recentsurvey from Concur, 96% of global business travellers are willing to travel for business over the next 12 months. How companies meet the new and evolving needs of their travellers whilst promoting travel policy compliance will be a careful balancing act. For businesses, delivering the same travel policy each year and expecting the same level of compliance and traveller satisfaction may be a challenge. Employees have come to expect more flexible working conditions and flexible travel programs to better integrate business travel with their personal lives. According toConcur’sresearch, new benefits that business travellers now expect from their employers include the ability to choose direct flights (52%), stay in four to five-star hotels (41%), and select premium seating, like first or business class (39%).  Businesses that invest in evolving their travel policies to support the objectives of productivity, comfort, safety, and well-being may find the perfect balance between policy compliance, traveller experience, and employee engagement. Modern-day traveller Hybrid working models have provided people with flexibility and as such, created a new level of expectation for the end-to-end traveller experience. Employees are more likely to prioritise their comfort, safety, convenience, and brand loyalty over their employer’s goal of savings and compliance. Duty of care is more important than ever, with safety continuing to be a priority for business travellers and travel managers.Corporate Travel Management’s(CTM’s) 2021 Business Travel Survey demonstrated thattraveller risk, safety and well-being were the top priorities for travel programs in 2022.Where travel services were once selected by price, on-time performance, seat pitch, and luggage allowance, today’s travellers want to understand the supplier safety and cleanliness measures of hotels, airlines and airports at the time of booking. Preferred suppliers must today be able to meet the requested standards of companies as well as the expectations and preferences of the business traveller to drive ongoing compliance. A 2022reportfrom the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA) indicated that heavy workloads and unused vacation days mean employees plan to make the most of their upcoming business travel, with89% of global business travellers surveyed saying they will add personal vacation time to their business trips in the next 12 months. Travellers are increasingly blending work and leisure and, as such, seeking flexibility with travel arrangements, dates and schedules.  Recruitment and retention With many people currently reconsidering their career paths, corporate travel policies are increasingly positioned as a key differentiator for retaining and recruiting talent. Since travel policy and experiences directly impact the quality of the employee experience, there’s great strategic value for Human Resource Managers to have visibility into travel policies and a strong relationship with their company’s Travel Managers, or the department that manages travel. The effects that a travel program has on employee recruitment and retention are often overlooked. According to theGlobal Business Travel Association(GBTA), 79% of North American business travellers, 83% of European business travellers, 81% across the Asia-Pacific region indicated that their business travel experience impacts their overall job satisfaction. In North America,59% of travellers say that a company’s travel policy is an important factor when considering a new job.  Traveller-focused programs lead the way in addressing ancillary travel services such as dining and parking in their travel policy. Those that have ancillary services included in their policy are also often likely to have traveller satisfaction programs that allow them to measure their employee’s travel experience. Categories that are measured might be air, hotel, ground transfers, dining, parking and bleisure travel. A report conducted byGBTA[1] found on average60% of buyers who measure such categories say they drive significant traveller satisfaction. Over half of the companies that measure the effectiveness of their traveller satisfaction program do so through cost savings and policy compliance. It is important to keep a company’s culture and business goals in mind while setting policies that help the traveller achieve their business goals when travelling. Policies should support the company’s overall goals while also enabling employees to be the most productive, safe and comfortable they can be while travelling for work. Understanding your employee’s travel needs, whether via traveller surveys or traveller focused programs, will enable a business to deliver a carefully crafted travel program with a flexible policy that promotes compliance and delivers a positive traveller experience.

https://au.travelctm.com/blog/leveraging-travel-expense-data/,"Leveraging travel expense data Most travel programs can easily identify out of policy expenses, but are you leveraging that information to prevent exceptions in the future? Based on a recentGBTA/AirPlus study, nearly 80% of programs look for out of policy costs on expense reports. But only 54% of programs regularly reconcile expensed data against what was booked for travel, and only 55% use expense data to adjust or inform their travel policy! Expense data can be useful to understand employee behaviour and why exceptions are occurring. It offers an opportunity to address those concerns and potentially alleviate traveller friction and/or increase policy compliance. Pre-ticketing information, available through CTM’s SMART Data, allows you to monitor traveller bookings and capture policy exceptions before they occur. Analysing policy, exceptions and expensed data can help you adjust program parameters to mitigate out of policy requests at the point of sale and address points of traveller friction which impede travellers’ productivity and job performance. Here are four ways CTM works with our clients to leverage expense data to drive travel policy development and program initiatives: 1. Refining rate limits. Are your travellers frequently choosing hotels that are out of your preferred network? Are your travel patterns putting travellers in high capacity major cities during events that raise daily rates? CTM can help you analyse your exception data to implement a hotel policy with appropriate rate caps per night, or scalable rates based on best available rates in major cities. CTM also has access to technology that provides rate integrity checks, ensuring that the contracted room type, with fixed discount, has availability at the times your travellers require them. 2. Align policy with user groups and reward road warriors. Are certain groups of travellers consistently expensing travel reservations that are out of policy for due cause? We tailor policy levels to multiple user groups while also considering individual preferences. This allows you to set out-of-policy exceptions and alerts for general user groups, while still catering to your elite travellers, top producers, and executives. 3. Mitigate direct buying and leakage. We help our clients establish adoption campaigns, design supplier promotions, identify program ambassadors, and engage reluctant users directly. CTM can help you communicate with travellers through traditional and non-traditional channels directed at driving traveller choice and behaviour. We apply policy and tailored messaging to our booking tools, mobile applications, gamification tools, scripting, direct traveller and agent communications and more. We can also bundle the flight and accommodation into a singular booking, with no additional costs. This enhances corporate duty of care by ensuring traveller movements can be monitored easily and effectively through one booking. 4. Providing technology to make SMART decisions In addition to our personalised service, CTM gives you the tools needed to quickly and efficiently identify possible cost savings in the purchasing and booking process; through predictive forecasting, behaviour and trend analysis and industry benchmarking. Furthermore, access to frequently updated pre-ticketing data allows you to capture and respond to policy breaches and reduce spend through improved policy compliance. This is all supported through a single, global reporting hub. Is your TMC helping you leverage your expense data into actionable travel program strategy? If you are not leveraging your expense data into going forward travel policy strategies, you may risk advancing overall program goals, continued leakage, poor program visibility and increased cost.
